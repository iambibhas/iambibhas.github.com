        I'm Bibhas Chandra Debnath. A 23 years old fellow from India. I'm from Kolkata. Currently staying at Bangalore. I'm a B.Tech Graduate in Information Technology. Now working as a developer. I love fiddling with codes. Language is no bar.

        I am active in many online discussion forums line <a class="aptureEnhance" href="http://superuser.com/users/27555/bibhas" target="_blank">Superuser</a>, <a class="aptureEnhance" href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/257944/bibhas" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="http://webapps.stackexchange.com/users/10110/bibhas" target="_blank">WebApps</a>.
        I'm a bit lazy when it comes to writing stuff. Hence I'm not much active in blogging. But I tweet regularly. I like providing feedback on products/services. And if its open source, I like to have a peek. I'm a FOSS enthusiast. most of my works are Open source and <a class="aptureEnhance" href="https://github.com/iambibhas" target="_blank">available on Github</a>. I mostly work on Ubuntu.

        I also encourage entrepreneurship as I think there's no fun like accomplishing something yourself. :)
