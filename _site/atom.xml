   <title>The festival of colors, Holi and me</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Holi as a festival kind of sucks for me. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of having fun while bathing in artifical colors.  So, I have to stay home for at least 3 days when everybody is &amp;ldquo;spreading the joy&amp;rdquo; outside. And if I go outside, they will share their &amp;ldquo;joy&amp;rdquo; with me too regardless of if I want to be a part of it or not. And they are not very considerate either. We Indians are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; strict about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time Holi is actually being awesome because four of us friends are staying inside with our computers. Wherever I look there is code, computer, boxes of foods that have been eaten, camera, bean bag and lot of concentration. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to become a bit less Indian about it and not forcing others to do the same. With you all(well, maybe not all) a Happy Holi.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Moments from PyCon India 2013</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/moments-from-pycon-india-2013/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-08T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/moments-from-pycon-india-2013</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;And just like that, PyCon India 2013 is over. A lot of hard work and dedications comes to an end for another year. Yet extremely happy because all those hard works yielded really awesome feedback. People have enjoyed those 3 days. That&amp;rsquo;s all we needed to make sure would happen. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I reached B'lore on 28th, changed from the original plan of going on 29th. I thought it&amp;rsquo;d better to reach with two days of time in hand so that I can help prepare for the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 29th evening, went to CIS to help pack the equipments to bring to the event venue. Did some good amount of counting and packing. Then got a car and brought everything to the venue and started preparing for the next day. Unlike the last time, this year we had a lot of volunteers on the day before the event to help us with the preparation. And that really helped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; started &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/7lTXJaydG6&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/7lTXJaydG6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; kushaldas (@kushaldas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kushaldas/statuses/373292924164796416&quot;&gt;August 30, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;On 30th morning, I had to go to HasGeek&amp;rsquo;s workshop office to pick up few more equipments, that made me late to reach the venue. By the time I was there, the registration had already started. I, along with Iliyas and Haseeb, had to take care of setting up the registration and sponsor booth systems. Whole day went testing and setting the systems up. And the first day went smoothly. Participants liked the workshops. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t attend any of them. At the end of the day, we needed one of the Asus Eee PCs to be configured so that it can be used for registration the next day, so brought it home with me. Installed Ubuntu and learned that Unity &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; play well on netbooks. So install gnome-classic. Then it started working smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On 31st morning, it was raining well, that caused some good amount of traffic jam on road and I guess thanks to that there was not much crowd on the registration desk. There were a lot of running around to get registration kits from inventory to the registration desk. And it was done well enough to not have a huge queue waiting to be registered. We had about 1000 registered participants. The registration was done really smoothly even despite that. That went really well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration complete. Nice spell of rain. Now in auditorium 1 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackerhack&quot;&gt;@jackerhack&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s keynote at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; sankarshan সঙ্কর্ষণ (@sankarshan) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sankarshan/statuses/373644104178991104&quot;&gt;August 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration started for main conference &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/rrnmC1QoZh&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/rrnmC1QoZh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; kushaldas (@kushaldas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kushaldas/statuses/373652270111420417&quot;&gt;August 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the food was arranged and it got some really good feedback from participants. In all that mess, missed the keynote by @jackerhack on paradox of code. :( Anyway, watched it right after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_stsJlNgGfA&amp;amp;feature=c4-overview-vl&amp;amp;list=PL6GW05BfqWIdsaaV35jcHWPWTI-DAw6Yn&quot;&gt;the video was uploaded on Youtube&lt;/a&gt;. Good one. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynote at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jackerhack&quot;&gt;@jackerhack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/84eCC2pO0j&quot;&gt;http://t.co/84eCC2pO0j&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rishi Mukherjee (@RishiMukherjee2) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RishiMukherjee2/statuses/373859579127291905&quot;&gt;August 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From morning keynote &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/MAzH5Oxs6q&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/MAzH5Oxs6q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; kushaldas (@kushaldas) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kushaldas/statuses/373707233617391617&quot;&gt;August 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyCon, event where even mic is tested speaking &amp;#39;hello world&amp;#39;.&amp;#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PyConIndia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#PyConIndia2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Gautam Singh (@CrypticSham9) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CrypticSham9/statuses/373738920921403392&quot;&gt;August 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then we had to start running to sponsor booths to set up the Contact point system. It in a software developed by team @hasgeek(mostly) for making it possible to exchange contacts betweek event participants and sponsors without much hassles. Although, there were some glitches here and there, the systems worked. Had to hunt down rogue WiFi access points running around the venue. That was fun. And the lunch was great. Met a lot of old friends from last and last last PyCons. Some of them, like @bhauvrat were wearing the PyCon 2011 t-shirt. Sadly I&amp;rsquo;ve outgrown that t-shirt. Still cherish it though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; keeps getting awesome. The response is awesome, the talks are awesome !!! &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Konark Modi (@konarkmodi) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/konarkmodi/statuses/373716942609084417&quot;&gt;August 31, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So who were the volunteers for catering? This is the best food in &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconindia&quot;&gt;@pyconindia&lt;/a&gt; yet! &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Abdul Muneer (@abdulmuneer) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/abdulmuneer/statuses/374079342805925891&quot;&gt;September 1, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The second day went great. Konark did a great job managing the volunteers. Althought there were few rough spots. Some of them could not be found throughout the event. But we took on the tasks and completed it. Tried to make sure that the participants don&amp;rsquo;t face any trouble. From the tweets I saw, it seemed we succeeded. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keynote by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kennethreitz&quot;&gt;@kennethreitz&lt;/a&gt; has just begun: &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/q6AjRwNJDV&quot;&gt;http://t.co/q6AjRwNJDV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Harshad Sharma (@hiway) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hiway/statuses/374020620989628416&quot;&gt;September 1, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The third day started slow. As most of the participants registered the day before, the rush was less, so I got to attend the keynote on second day by @kennethreitz. He shared his experience on running an open source project. Some good lessons. Maybe I can use them someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;documentation is the glue that makes Open Source possible&amp;quot; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; sankarshan সঙ্কর্ষণ (@sankarshan) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sankarshan/statuses/374022910060396544&quot;&gt;September 1, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn to say no to crazy features: &amp;quot;Simplicity is better than functionality&amp;quot; - Pieter Hinjesns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kennethreitz&quot;&gt;@kennethreitz&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23PyconIndia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#PyconIndia2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Arnab Deka (@arnab_deka) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/arnab_deka/statuses/374025748291391488&quot;&gt;September 1, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Almost around the lunch time we wrapped up the registration and started preparing for distributing the t-shirts. On the time of registration, each person was given a RFID card which they could use to share their contacts, and we needed them back. So what we did was we gave out the t-shirts only in exchange of the RFID cards. And that worked &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well. We got back more than 95% cards I think. And people were really happy with the t-shirts. The volunteers also got a bottle from Bluejeans, one of the sponsors. That also made them extra happy for all the effort they put in those 3 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;T shirt queue &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/pyconindia&quot;&gt;@pyconindia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/PZqbhDTO06&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/PZqbhDTO06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Anuvrat Parashar (@bhanuvrat) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bhanuvrat/statuses/374062976514289664&quot;&gt;September 1, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;#39;s T-shirt and promotional graphics are really good. Kudos to the designer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Jishnu (@jishnu7) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/jishnu7/statuses/374062564407144448&quot;&gt;September 1, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;404 Registration. :-) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/JOvO35KhK4&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/JOvO35KhK4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Vivek Anand (@insidevivek) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/insidevivek/statuses/374132068747182081&quot;&gt;September 1, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then the sun went down. The end of the event was near. And we attended the IPSS AGM. Konark was chosen to be the Vise President of IPSS. It was a great move. :) Happy that it happened. We also got a lot of new members for IPSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awesome team that made AV possible at &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; :) way to go guys,&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/the_codebot&quot;&gt;@the_codebot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anandology&quot;&gt;@anandology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/VoN9N7Zg0B&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/VoN9N7Zg0B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Vishal Sood (@VishalSood114) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/VishalSood114/statuses/374167156142788609&quot;&gt;September 1, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;




&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The real rockstars of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/pUx73My4Nf&quot;&gt;http://t.co/pUx73My4Nf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; sankarshan সঙ্কর্ষণ (@sankarshan) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sankarshan/statuses/376420382040797184&quot;&gt;September 7, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then everyone started heading home, and we started packing everything up. 3 long days of efforts came to an end. Most of the volunteers were gone at that point. Only handful of us were left. We packed everything up and said good bye. It was 3 days of awesomeness working with these people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt;, a very well organized event.Congrats &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anandology&quot;&gt;@anandology&lt;/a&gt; and team for the wonderful effort!! Looking forward to pycon inda 2014 :)&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Rahul Krishna Upadhy (@RahulKrishnaUp) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RahulKrishnaUp/statuses/374290768145313792&quot;&gt;September 1, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After everything was packed, it seemed that I was the only one left to bring &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; back to CIS. We rented a car, loaded everything on it and I rode with the driver in front seat. After dropping everything at the CIS with the help from the driver, just when I was going to leave, it started raining. I asked that car driver to give me a lift at least till the main road so that I could get an auto. The driver was kind enough to give me a lift almost to my home. :) Really grateful to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I decided to treat myself in completing all the tasks for PyCon India 2013. Went to Mani&amp;rsquo;s Biryani and had some. Satisfactory food. I was just really glad that everything went well. Checked the twitter timeline for the hashtag #pyconindia2013. It was full with positive feedback. As a volunteer, could not ask for anything more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who attended. I hope we could make it comfortable for you to attend the event. And hope to see you next year. Thank you. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I can&amp;rsquo;t end the blog post without mentioning Anand Chitipothu. He&amp;rsquo;s the one who made the event possible. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blogpost about &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pyconindia2013&amp;amp;src=hash&quot;&gt;#pyconindia2013&lt;/a&gt; is incomplete without mentioning &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anandology&quot;&gt;@anandology&lt;/a&gt;.

   <title>Python Month workshop at BPPIMT, Kolkata and NSEC, Kolkata</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/python-month-workshop-at-bppimt-kolkata/"/>
   <updated>2013-08-25T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/python-month-workshop-at-bppimt-kolkata</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This August has been special for all the Python lovers in India for it&amp;rsquo;s being celebrated as &amp;ldquo;Python Month&amp;rdquo; by PyCon India. Volunteers all around the country have been visiting colleges and organizing workshops to promote and spread the awesomeness of Python. There has been few workshops in West Bengal as well. I attended and helped organize two of them. One at the B.P.Poddar Institute of Management and Technology and Netaji Subhash Engineering College.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The workshop at BPPIMT was organized by CampusHash. Sanket and Rohit, who run CampusHash, has been kind enough to extend their support in organizing workshops around the country. The college management was really helpful, and the number of attendees were good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/bppimt_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/bppimt_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the other hand, NSEC had a very concentrated crowd. We had to organize it in a rush, so we had to do it small. We took a small computer lab so that everyone could try out things that were being discussed. The volunteers Debjeet, Sneha, Nilabhra, Puja and others from that college were really helpful and the workshop was a success. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/uploads/nsec.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has been more workshops in West Bengal. CampusHash organized two more workshops at Heritage Institute of Technology and Institute of Engineering and Management. And some students from B.C.Roy Engineering College, Durgapur organized another workshop there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just the start. PyCon is next week. After that we&amp;rsquo;ll have more of these coming to Kolkata. :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is Tornado?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/index.html&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; itself -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tornado is a Python web framework and asynchronous networking library, originally developed at FriendFeed. By using non-blocking network I/O, Tornado can scale to tens of thousands of open connections, making it ideal for long polling, WebSockets, and other applications that require a long-lived connection to each user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s basically a minimalistic web framework which supports non-blocking network operations. If you go through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/documentation.html&quot;&gt;list of modules&lt;/a&gt; it supports, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it has a lot of modules built in. But there is no proper tutorial of how to achieve most of the things. All the reference to the API is there though. So you must go ahead, read the API and figure out things yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to write about what is good or bad about it. This post is about how you can replace Tornado&amp;rsquo;s default template engine with Jinja2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mitsuhiko/jinja2&quot;&gt;Jinja2&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jinja2 is a modern and designer friendly templating language for Python, modelled after Django’s templates. It is fast, widely used and secure with the optional sandboxed template execution environment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tornado&amp;rsquo;s native template engine is good and really light-weight. But at the same time it lacks few features I wanted, which Jinja2 has. So I decided to replate tornado&amp;rsquo;s template engine with Jinja2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, you need to write a base handler which all the other handlers will inherit from. This is what I wrote -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import os
import tornado.web
from jinja2 import Environment, FileSystemLoader, TemplateNotFound


class TemplateRendering:
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    A simple class to hold methods for rendering templates.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def render_template(self, template_name, **kwargs):
        template_dirs = []
        if self.settings.get('template_path', ''):
            template_dirs.append(
                self.settings[&quot;template_path&quot;]
            )

        env = Environment(loader=FileSystemLoader(template_dirs))

        try:
            template = env.get_template(template_name)
        except TemplateNotFound:
            raise TemplateNotFound(template_name)
        content = template.render(kwargs)
        return content


class BaseHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler, TemplateRendering):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    RequestHandler already has a `render()` method. I'm writing another
    method `render2()` and keeping the API almost same.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    def render2(self, template_name, **kwargs):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        This is for making some extra context variables available to
        the template
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        kwargs.update({
            'settings': self.settings,
            'STATIC_URL': self.settings.get('static_url_prefix', '/static/'),
            'request': self.request,
            'xsrf_token': self.xsrf_token,
            'xsrf_form_html': self.xsrf_form_html,
        })
        content = self.render_template(template_name, **kwargs)
        self.write(content)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to use this base handler, you need to make few things sure that your application settings should have a &lt;code&gt;template_path&lt;/code&gt; key pointing to the absolute path of the directory holding all the templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can inherit this base handler and use jinja2 by default -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class RegisterHandler(BaseHandler):
    def get(self, **kwargs):
        data = {
            'foo': 'bar'
        }
        return self.render2('auth/register.html', **data)

    def post(self, **kwargs):
        self.check_xsrf_cookie()
        pass
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can use the &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; variable as &lt;code&gt;{{ foo }}&lt;/code&gt; in your jinja2 template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: I took some help from &lt;a href=&quot;http://aurigroup.wordpress.com/2011/02/21/a-good-start-with-google-app-engine-for-python/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Bangalore Story #1</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/my-bangalore-story-1/"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why #1? Because there is going to be #2 and maybe more. Most probably not in near future, but someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gist is, I&amp;rsquo;m heading back to Kolkata for now. Consider this post as a commit message to my life, for the changes in last few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First two months here were the worst. The &lt;em&gt;entrepreneur&lt;/em&gt; who hired me and convinced me to move here, betting a lot of savings of my parents, kept me sitting idle for a month and a half, and then declared that his idea isn&amp;rsquo;t working so he&amp;rsquo;s going after another idea and abandoning ship, without paying me or the my friend who was also on the same boat. That&amp;rsquo;s two months of no income for me. Of course I couldn&amp;rsquo;t tell my parents anything. They were already depending a lot on me and their health isn&amp;rsquo;t that good either. Hence I had to borrow money from some friends and manage somehow. And I&amp;rsquo;m still under a lot of debt. Thanks Mr Entrepreneur. You&amp;rsquo;re a real hero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of my parents' ill health and some more reasons, I had to visit Kolkata multiple times in last few months. And it had good travel costs. So actually, all my earnings in last few months, after paying rent and food cost, were spent on repaying debts. And I&amp;rsquo;ll still have to do that for next couple of months. I&amp;rsquo;m saving almost nothing staying here and also spending about 15k each month in living cost, which I could, maybe, save, if I were in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All thanks to a friend, who appeared as an angel and gave me another opportunity at LxiDD, I was able to recover most part of the crisis. I&amp;rsquo;ll be forever grateful to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city is great. The thing I liked most here, and which I also miss in Kolkata is that, people here are always active. They are talking, coming up with ideas, and, most importantly, executing those ideas no matter what. And I&amp;rsquo;ve made some really great friends among these people. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so many things. This is a nice city to live in too. Maybe someday..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still I decided to give up my job here and move because my parents need me right now. And swinging between two cities, is helping neither party much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One other major reason is, I&amp;rsquo;m not liking this long distance relationship thing. We&amp;rsquo;ve been together for just about a year and a half now. And I&amp;rsquo;m already running around, away from her. She&amp;rsquo;s been more supportive that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever imagined. She&amp;rsquo;s one of the most strong willed girl I&amp;rsquo;ve met. But I am weak. I simply cannot stay away from her. I know you must be smirking. I really don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t leave my job like this. Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to work remotely. But as it happens, my startup is not really ready to accept remote work. I&amp;rsquo;ll still be freelancing with them I guess. But I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t want to stop working with them. LxiDD and Kamelot Kapital is the best place I&amp;rsquo;ve worked till now. The people are so nice and friendly, and there are huge scopes of learning new things here. Someday I want to come back to Bangalore again. And I&amp;rsquo;m gonna check if they have any place for me. Well, my skills are not gonna get rusty, that I&amp;rsquo;m sure of. So, let&amp;rsquo;s see. :P&lt;br/&gt;
For now, I&amp;rsquo;d recomment any of my friends to join Kamelot Kapital/LxiDD if they can. Well, with me going out, they have a vacancy right now. If you&amp;rsquo;re up for it, just shoot a mail to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:jobs@lxidd.com&quot;&gt;jobs@lxidd.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t take my career so lightly. But I have always did things the way I felt were right. Well, most of the decisions till now turned out to be bad decisions, and they had their prices too. But the way I see it, in exchange of all the bad times, I always get something good back. So, I&amp;rsquo;m going to do it again this time. Let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tornado + WTForms = TypeError: formdata should be a multidict type wrapper ...</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/tornado-wtforms-typeerror-formdata-should-be-a-multidict-type-wrapper/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-25T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/tornado--wtforms--typeerror-formdata-should-be-a-multidict-type-wrapper-</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re here from some search engine, that means you&amp;rsquo;ve been working with Tornado and WTForms, and you&amp;rsquo;ve faced the same error -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(Pdb) form = SomeForm(self.request.arguments)
*** TypeError: formdata should be a multidict-type wrapper that supports the 'getlist' method
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, Tornado does provide a dictionary that contains the data like a MultiDict should do for GET/POST/others request arguments -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{'_xsrf': ['b2c0d0bebbf84516a8aa0462bb41ea0f'], 'password': ['password'], 'email': ['mail@gmail.com']}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it sends it as a dictionary -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(Pdb) type(self.request.arguments)
&amp;lt;type 'dict'&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And Python dictionaries don&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;code&gt;getlist()&lt;/code&gt; method. And WTForms requires the arguments object to have that method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Workaround?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SimpleMultiDict(dict):
    def getlist(self, key):
        return self[key]

    def __repr__(self):
        return type(self).__name__ + '(' + dict.__repr__(self) + ')'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This simply makes a subclass of &lt;code&gt;dict&lt;/code&gt; and adds the &lt;code&gt;getlist()&lt;/code&gt; method. So, What did we gain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(Pdb) SimpleMultiDict(self.request.arguments)
SimpleMultiDict({'_xsrf': ['b2c0d0bebbf84516a8aa0462bb41ea0f'], 'password': ['password'], 'email': ['mail@gmail.com']})
(Pdb) arguments = SimpleMultiDict(self.request.arguments)
(Pdb) dir(arguments)
['__class__', (skipping some default methods) , 'clear', 'copy', 'fromkeys', 'get', 'getlist', 'has_key', 'items', 'iteritems', 'iterkeys', 'itervalues', 'keys', 'pop', 'popitem', 'setdefault', 'update', 'values', 'viewitems', 'viewkeys', 'viewvalues']

# Notice the getlist() method

(Pdb) arguments.getlist('email')
['mail@gmail.com']
(Pdb) form = LoginForm(arguments)
(Pdb) form.email.data
'mail@gmail.com'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now there is a point to note here. Tornado sends the arguments data in a simple dictionary that has each of the values inside a list. Here is a pointer if you&amp;rsquo;re using some framework that sends a simple dictionary, with the arguments &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; in list, and that also doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;code&gt;getlist()&lt;/code&gt; method, just change the &lt;code&gt;getlist()&lt;/code&gt; method to this -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SimpleMultiDict(dict):
    def getlist(self, key):
        return self[key] if type(self[key]) == list else [self[key]]

    def __repr__(self):
        return type(self).__name__ + '(' + dict.__repr__(self) + ')'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This just turns the simgle values to a list, just what &lt;code&gt;getlist()&lt;/code&gt; is supposed to do.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Interactive Shell Access to Tornado Local Environment</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/interactive-shell-access-to-tornado-local-environment/"/>
   <updated>2013-04-21T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/shell-access-to-tornado-local-environment</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/&quot;&gt;Tornado&lt;/a&gt; for last few days and I really needed a shell access to the local virtual environment of my Tornado app so that I can test few things out. Exactly like Django has &lt;code&gt;./manage.py shell&lt;/code&gt;. But as we all know Tornado lacks a good documentation. Most of the things except the use of the native classes, require a lot of trial and error(at least for me, I&amp;rsquo;m not so bright). So I looked around and found how &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/23/&quot;&gt;has a way&lt;/a&gt; of having an interactive shell access to the environment. And I just replicated it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Create a file called &lt;code&gt;shell.py&lt;/code&gt;(or whatever you like) on the root of your project and put these codes in it -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python

import os
import readline
from pprint import pprint

# Your app file
from app import * 

# These project specific. But I need these to run my project
from config import *
from settings import *

# This is the main part
os.environ['PYTHONINSPECT'] = 'True'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Python documentation -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;PYTHONINSPECT&lt;br/&gt;
If this is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying the &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;br/&gt;
This variable can also be modified by Python code using os.environ to force inspect mode on program termination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt; option -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;-i&lt;br/&gt;
When a script is passed as first argument or the -c option is used, enter interactive mode after executing the script or the command, even when sys.stdin does not appear to be a terminal. The PYTHONSTARTUP file is not read.&lt;br/&gt;
This can be useful to inspect global variables or a stack trace when a script raises an exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now just navigate to your project root and execute &lt;code&gt;python shell.py&lt;/code&gt; or you can do &lt;code&gt;./shell.py&lt;/code&gt; if you know how. This will take you to an interactive shell where you can play around with your project.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2013-04-15T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/shubho-nababarsha-1420</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d have &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; regretted if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t come home for the Bengali New Year. This is one of those days when you get to see Bongs showing off their Bong-ness. I mean if you visit the City Center you&amp;rsquo;ll see that they have stalls and frying fish in bengali recipes. Girls and Ladies are wearing Sharees, guys are wearing Panjabi. Singing and playing Bengali songs loudly in every locality. People would behave more lethargic than Ever. So on and so forth ..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among all of these things, I got to see a glimpse of the True bong spirit today. A cute sister of mine is a student at Arena Multimedia. And Arena celebrates Bengali new year with a small function among the students, teachers and staffs. Outsiders are usually not told about this, but my sis got me, her elder sister and her brother to attend it becasue, for the first time, she was going to dance in a function. And we 3 being her most favorite people, were invited to watch it. That&amp;rsquo;s another major reason I came to Kolkata this time. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t miss this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they sang. Rabindranath, Jibanananda, bangla band, Anjan Datta; they left nothing. And they performed &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; well. There were moments like &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; singing &amp;ldquo;Bela Bose&amp;rdquo; together in open voice without any tension, making fun impressions in the process. Or some of them dancing and others cheering them up or just watching quietly. There were moments of reciting self-composed poems. Those are some talented kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there were moments where someone was dancing a break-dance score from a movie called &amp;ldquo;Student of the year&amp;rdquo;. I think it released this year. And someone singing a hindi song that had absolutely no relationship with the event. But anyway, was glad to see their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, I also visited a friend&amp;rsquo;s office and did some brainstorming. Good start of the bengali year overall. Hope this year goes well for you people reading this blog post too. Shubho Nababarsha. শুভ নববর্ষ।&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Where Do I See Myself in 10 Years?</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/874/10-years-from-now/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-23T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/874/10-years-from-now</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Incident 1 (I'm in college, 1st year):&lt;/h3&gt;
The head of the dept. walks into our class, and throws us a question, &quot;Where do you see yourself in 10 years?&quot;. Honestly, I took that question a bit seriously, and that was the first time I realized that I didn't know what I should be in future. I didn't start as a developer then. Didn't even know I'm going to be what I am today. I was asked &quot;What is your aim in life?&quot; several times in my college days, I remember clearly that I answered differently every single time.
&lt;h3&gt;Incident 2 (1 year after I've started freelancing, 4th year of college):&lt;/h3&gt;
Few of my co-workers were already in their 3rd-4th startup, and were talking about what they want to do next(start up again if that one fails) and I was thrown the question, &quot;Bibhas, what are you going to do after college, and after couple of years?&quot;. I couldn't answer. I knew I will be working somewhere, developing something, but didn't know on what role, doing what.
&lt;h3&gt;Incident 3 (I left the first job because I didn't like it):&lt;/h3&gt;
And I'm thinking what to do next. Then it strikes me, I still didn't know what I want to be in life. I have ideas about how to build softwares, I want to keep doing it. But I also have a feeling that writing code takes a lot of time. It'd be nice if I had few colleagues writing codes. I was pretty sure this is going to be a deciding factor later in my life. But I still don't see the sign.
&lt;h3&gt;Incident 4 (a week back):&lt;/h3&gt;
I was talking to a colleague. He's seen his share of startup lives. We were talking about few of my friends who don't want to take risks working in startups and keep working at MNCs because those jobs are &quot;safe&quot;. Then he says, &quot;They should realize, are they living a life which they can tell their kids about?&quot;. I laughed in my head, thinking of a friend of mine telling his kid, &quot;You know? I used to work at an MNC. I used to go to office every freaging day at 9am and return at 10pm. I had a wonderful life.&quot; Don't know about you, but that seemed effin hilarious to me. But then I thought they might not realize it and think that they are too young to start &quot;taking risks&quot;.
&lt;h3&gt;Incident 5 (Present day):&lt;/h3&gt;
I come across this question in Quora: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Life/What-do-you-regret-not-doing-in-your-20s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you regret not doing in your 20s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

It has few answers from people of 30s, sharing their views. I'd like to quote some of them here.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The only thing I regret in my 20's is not taking more risks. I took a ton of risks in my 20's from what I studied in school to where I lived to who I wanted to be. In the end, I could have been more fearless and more courageous to be exactly who I wanted to be, no matter what.

    The only advice I can offer: Do not listen to anyone else when you make big life decisions. No one knows you like you. When you make a big decision, do not listen to your parents, your siblings, your friends, or anyone else. It sounds absurd, but when I look back on my 20's the best decisions I made were ones I made myself that were protested by everyone around me.

    When you can stand truly on your own to make the correct choice while everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong, you're doing it right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;It's not regret. But looking back, it seems my life would have been better if I had done / had known these earlier:
        &lt;ul&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On love:&lt;/strong&gt; Leave an unhappy relationship. It's not about commitment. It's about how to respect yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On work:&lt;/strong&gt; Quit an unhappy job. The feeling of being caged, deprived of the opportunity to learn new things simply because of your role - are not compensated by pay or even gratification of supporting your loved ones.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Appreciate, listen to, even indulge in emotions sometimes. It keeps a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;human&lt;/span&gt; life. No worries, we're rational enough. Our brain is amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On body:&lt;/strong&gt; Have happy (safe) sex more and earlier. Play fun sports more and earlier. Feeling a cramp in my leg once saved me from depression due to overthinking.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On money:&lt;/strong&gt; More is not better. There's a threshold over which you feel secured and free to pursue your dreams. Work constantly to lower this threshold. It frees you from constraints that you set for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On desire/passion:&lt;/strong&gt; It's OK that desire/passion changes over time. Someday the dots can be linked. Before that, follow the passion even as it takes leaps and seems without focus.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On fear:&lt;/strong&gt; Never act/decide out of fear. You're doomed. Lying is an example.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On people:&lt;/strong&gt; Stay around those you want to become. If your network is not given, create it yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On human life:&lt;/strong&gt; You can change your life. Be kind, be honest (to others and to yourself), be grateful. Genuine happiness triumphs.&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   ...
   &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not taking more risks.&lt;/strong&gt;

    Your 20s aren't like your 30s. You can afford to take more chances, try more things, take more risks to find out who you are and where you want to be.

    &lt;strong&gt;Not taking more action.&lt;/strong&gt;

    I thought that navel-gazing would lead me to answers to the existential angst which bugged me during my 20s. &lt;em&gt;Wrong&lt;/em&gt;. Acting and trying new things is the way to answers.

    &lt;strong&gt;Not sleeping around more.&lt;/strong&gt;

    In your 30s, you and the people you meet are looking for long-term commitment. If I were 20 again I'd stop looking for 'the one true love' (what can I say, I was a romantic) and look for more people to connect with, heart as well as body. Pining around for someone who didn't love me back on a off-on thing was a long waste of a few years.

    &lt;strong&gt;Not taking care of my body more.&lt;/strong&gt;

    In your 20s, you're in that weird transition where your body is somewhat but not quite as fit as your teen years and going into the less-hardy 30s. The start of my beer belly wasn't dramatic, and I figured it would go away like it always had in my teens. &lt;em&gt;Wrong.&lt;/em&gt; Once you see yourself going in your 20s, workout like hell to get yourself back in health and shape.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    ...
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Well, if not entirely similar, I know I'm going to have some views that are common with these above. And I still don't know &lt;em&gt;what I'll be&lt;/em&gt; after 10 years.

    Right now I've bet everything I have on my instincts. I've moved to a new city. I've set up a decent place to stay even before getting the first salary. My bank balance is near zero. And my parents have already started pushing me about the deadline of my marriage!! BIG Sigh.

    On the bright side, I have this lovely girl beside me who thinks the world of me. I have my parents beside me who, even when we're running low on savings, are supporting me to do what I feel is right. I have an awesome colleague whom I've started to think as my mentor. I have few awesome friends who support me even when I'm down to the ground. I've already been part of 2 startups where things didn't quite work out as they planned. Yet I've joined another one.

    And I just realized, I really don't care anymore about what I want to be 10 years later. I'm just going to do what, I feel, is right and see where it goes. I have enough skills to earn my bread everyday. That's more than enough for me to go on.

   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/847/how-to-reach-pycon-india-2012/"/>
   <updated>2012-09-26T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/847/how-to-reach-pycon-india-2012</id>
   <content type="html">I had a quick visit to the venue today. As I'm volunteering this time, will be visiting tomorrow too, to help set up everything including the directions. So I thought, it's better if I just let you know of the location of the venue.

It's just beside &lt;a href=&quot;http://goo.gl/maps/3rljG&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Christ College&lt;/strong&gt; bus stoppage&lt;/a&gt;. For those who don't know, here is the general location of the Christ college stoppage and the venue -

[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;615&quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/nNgfh.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;PyCon 2012 Venue&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/nNgfh.png&quot; alt=&quot;PyCon 2012 Venue&quot; width=&quot;615&quot; height=&quot;395&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; PyCon 2012 Venue[/caption]

Once you get to the Christ College stoppage, follow this path -

[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;610&quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/iUUbR.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;  &quot; title=&quot;PyCon 2012 closer map&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/iUUbR.png&quot; alt=&quot;PyCon 2012 closer map&quot; width=&quot;610&quot; height=&quot;415&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; PyCon 2012 closer map[/caption]

And you'll find yourself at the venue. :)

Just for reference, here is the co-ordinates of the venue - &lt;a title=&quot;PyCon India 2012 Venue&quot; href=&quot;https://maps.google.co.in/?q=loc:12.9349,77.6052&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;12.9349, 77.6052&lt;/a&gt;(Clickable).

See you at the venue. :)

   <title>Why You Should Be Bothered About Twitter's t.co Url Shortener And A Way To Bypass It</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/836/why-you-should-be-bothered-about-twitters-t-co-url-shortener-and-a-way-to-bypass-it/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-26T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/836/why-you-should-be-bothered-about-twitters-t-co-url-shortener-and-a-way-to-bypass-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;The way to bypass the t.co url is only for Twitter Web users. If you're not using it, If you're using an app, it wont help you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since the very moment twitter introduced the automatic link shortening of all the links posted with it&amp;rsquo;s own t.co shortener, it bothered me. Why? Let me explain.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is using this t.co shortener just to track all the links being shared across it&amp;rsquo;s site. It can track how many links are being shared and how many of them are clicked. (Technically hat also enables them to know which resources are being more popular among the users. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how they are using that data.) But the real trouble is, t.co is just another server on your way to the original url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you notice carefully, most of the links you share or click nowadays are already shortened. And thanks to services like bit.ly, everyone can make a new link shortener in no time. While these shortened urls do look nice, they just push one node away from your destination node. When you click a shortened url, you are taken to the server where the link shortener is hosted and then redirected to the original destination. So, if it were to take you 100ms to reach your url, it&amp;rsquo;ll take you some more time than that if you click the shortener url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;t.co is adding another node above what you already have. So that&amp;rsquo;s two node you have to be redirected from. For example, take this tweet -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where Have The Users Gone? &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/acgTzWKR&quot; title=&quot;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&quot;&gt;tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&lt;/a&gt; by @&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nireyal&quot;&gt;nireyal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/239765316601802752&quot;&gt;August 26, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch already uses their own url shortener tcrn.ch, as you see. And when they share it on Twitter, it&amp;rsquo;s being shortened with the t.co url shortener. When you read the tweet, you can see the tcrn.ch url, but if you click it, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;ll take you to a t.co link. That means, it&amp;rsquo;s an anchor, when the original url is the text and the t.co link is the url. That&amp;rsquo;s an effin bummer. :|&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is how you have to visit your document now -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/acgTzWKR&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://t.co/acgTzWKR&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/26/where-have-the-users-gone/&quot;&gt;http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/26/where-have-the-users-gone/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have to go through two server before I can get to my link. That&amp;rsquo;s really a pain in the arse for me, and should be for you too. Because if anyday the t.co server is slow because of the constant load it serves, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I effin hate that. So wanted to get my way around it. I inspected the anchor tag of Twitter Web, this is what I got -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:js&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/acgTzWKR&quot; class=&quot;twitter-timeline-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-expanded-url=&quot;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&quot; title=&quot;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; wotsearchprocessed=&quot;true&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class=&quot;invisible&quot;&amp;gt;http://&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&amp;gt;tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class=&quot;invisible&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;span class=&quot;invisible&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now if you see closely, twitter stores the original url as the value of &lt;span class=&quot;lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;data-expanded-url&lt;/span&gt; in the anchor tag. That is good for me. I just pushed a simple Javascript code that replaces the value of href property with the value of &lt;span class=&quot;lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;data-expanded-url&lt;/span&gt;&amp;rsquo;s value. And my work is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the javascript code -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:js&quot;&gt;si = window.setInterval(clearanchors, 2000);
function clearanchors(){
    anchors = document.getElementsByTagName('a')
    for(i=0;i&amp;lt;anchors.length;i++){
        if(anchors[i].getAttribute('data-expanded-url') != null){
        anchors[i].setAttribute('href', anchors[i].getAttribute('data-expanded-url'));
        }
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Just use any javascript pusher and push this to twitter.com. I personally use &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plcnnpdmhobdfbponjpedobekiogmbco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Personalized Web&lt;/a&gt;. so I created this recipe for it -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screenshot-08262012-104737-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-837&quot; title=&quot;Screenshot - 08262012 - 10:47:37 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screenshot-08262012-104737-PM-300x184.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I added it as timed function because or else it wont change the urls Twitter Web loads with ajax.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Zen of Python</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These are the guiding principles of Python, but are open to interpretation. A sense of humor is required for their proper interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Rooting Xperia Neo V MT11i with 4.0.2.A.0.62 Build (on Ubuntu)</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/788/rooting-xperia-neo-v-mt11i-with-4-0-2-a-0-62-build-on-ubuntu/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/788/rooting-xperia-neo-v-mt11i-with-4-0-2-a-0-62-build-on-ubuntu</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: While rooting, unlocking bootloader would wipe all your phone's data and apps. So Backup before proceeding!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;Getting straight to the point, here is a step by step guide to rooting an Xperia Neo V MT11i on Ubuntu 11.10.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Small note: If you're running Windows, ignore step 1 and 3 and have the phone's USB drivers installed properly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;span class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;libusb-dev&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline&quot;&gt;libusb-1.0-0-dev&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href=&quot;http://androxyde.github.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flashtool&lt;/a&gt;. Download both 0.8.0.0 and 0.8.6.0 update. Extract both, then copy-paste the files from 0.8.6.0 folder to 0.8.0.0 folder. So that you have the updated version.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From terminal, go to the FlashTool directory, and run it -
&lt;pre class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true&quot;&gt;$ ./FlashTool&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Once FlashTool runs, turn on USB Debugging from the Settings&amp;gt;Applications&amp;gt;Development and Unknown Sources from the Settings&amp;gt;Applications.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Connect your phone to USB, &lt;strong&gt;Not in Mass Storage Device mode&lt;/strong&gt;. If it's connected successfully, you'll see some logs on the window of Flashtool. If there is any error, ask me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Now you have to check if your phone's Boot loader is unlocked. To root, the boot loader needs to be unlocked. To check, Dial *#*#7378423#*#* . Then go to -&amp;gt; &quot;Service Info&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;Configuration&quot;. If there is:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bootloader unlock allowed - Yes &amp;lt;&amp;lt; this means that your Bootloader is Locked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bootloader Unlocked - Yes &amp;lt;&amp;lt; this means that your bootloader is unlocked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If BL is locked, from Flashtool, go to Plugins &amp;gt; Bootloader Unlock &amp;gt; Run and follow the instructions. At one point, it'll send you to Sony website for the unlock code where you have to approve the fact that your warranty is being void. :P&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Once the BL is unlocked, your phone would boot and you'll have lost all your apps, data, everything. You may then start from scratch again or restore from any previous backup.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=25610423&amp;amp;postcount=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the tutorial at XDA&lt;/a&gt;. Ignore step 2 of that guide if you are using Ubuntu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
You'll have your phone rooted in no time. :)

   <title>PyCon India 2012 Registration is Open!</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/pycon-india-2012-registration-is-open"/>
   <updated>2012-06-19T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/pycon-india-2012-registration-is-open</id>
   <content type="html">PyCon is here again! Last year had awesome fun at PyCon 2011 as a beginner python-tamer. This time I'm hoping to have even more fun because I'll be able to understand more of what they are saying. :P&lt;!--more--&gt;

Unlike last time, PyCon 2012 is going to be held in Bangalore, at Dharmaram Vidya Kshetram from September 28-30. More details can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://in.pycon.org/2012/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on their website&lt;/a&gt;. And their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pyconindia2012.doattend.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;registration page is at DoAttend&lt;/a&gt;. The Early Bird tickets are Rs600 + Rs300. I just bought 'em. Go get them while they last.

&lt;iframe width=&quot;630&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://maps.google.co.in/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;cid=11253468343780601834&amp;amp;q=Dharmaram+Vidya+Kshetram+Library&amp;amp;gl=IN&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=12.932634,77.605018&amp;amp;spn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;amp;output=embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #0000ff; text-align: left;&quot; href=&quot;https://maps.google.co.in/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;cid=11253468343780601834&amp;amp;q=Dharmaram+Vidya+Kshetram+Library&amp;amp;gl=IN&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=12.932634,77.605018&amp;amp;spn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;amp;source=embed&quot;&gt;View Larger Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Venue being Bangalore is fine for me as I have a friend's home where I can stay. Last year had real trouble with the place to stay in Pune. Had to crash at some unknown friend(!)'s place, then book a hotel room etc etc. But not this time.

Hoping to have some real good time. Also hoping to meet few friends I've only spoken to via web. That should be fun. :)

&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: I wrote &lt;a title=&quot;PyCon India 2012 – More Details&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/785/pycon-india-2012-more-details/&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt; with more details about PyCon India 2012.

   <title>Development and Deployment of Flask app on Nginx with uWSGI+Supervisor</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/767/development-and-deployment-of-flask-app-on-nginx-with-uwsgi-supervisor/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-14T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/767/development-and-deployment-of-flask-app-on-nginx-with-uwsgi-supervisor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. And before you ask: It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/license/&quot;&gt;BSD licensed&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I came across &lt;a title=&quot;Flask&quot; href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; when I was going through the apps from &lt;a title=&quot;Hasgeek - Github&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hasgeek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hasgeek&lt;/a&gt;. All their sites are built on Flask. So I thought of giving it a try and I'm not disappointed.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Flask is awesome. Minimal, supports Jinja for template managing and all you have to do is work on your app logic. Very less work involved to manage the framework. Here are the quick steps to follow to develop with Flask and deploy the app on an Nginx server -
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Install Flask&quot; href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Install Flask in a vertualenv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make a file named your_app_name.py and &lt;a title=&quot;Flask Quickstart&quot; href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#quickstart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;start building your app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Test the app locally and when you think you're ready to deploy prepare your server.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install gcc, python, python-dev, python-virtualenv on your server.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Flask Deployment Options&quot; href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many deployment options&lt;/a&gt;, I chose uWSGI. It seemed to have very little footsteps.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Setup the virtualenv and transfer your files to server.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install uWSGI inside your virtualenv with pip.
&lt;pre class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true&quot;&gt;pip install uwsgi&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;uWSGI + Supervisor&quot; href=&quot;http://www.readncode.com/blog/Deploying-Flask-with-nginx-uWSGI-and-Supervisor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Deploy using uWSGI and Supervisor&lt;/a&gt;. Just one thing, instead of using that Symlink method to deploy your site, you might prefer to use these &lt;a title=&quot;nginx_ensite&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/perusio/nginx_ensite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nginx_ensite and nginx_dissite commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I made a special executable named &lt;span class=&quot;lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;nginx_renabsite&lt;/span&gt;that disables the provided site config, reloads the server, then enables new config and again reloads the server -
&lt;pre class=&quot;top-set:false bottom-set:false lang:sh decode:true &quot;&gt;nginx_dissite $1
/etc/init.d/nginx reload
nginx_ensite $1
/etc/init.d/nginx reload&lt;/pre&gt;
Place this file to &lt;span class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline&quot;&gt;/usr/sbin/nginx_renabsite&lt;/span&gt;and you can run it like
&lt;pre class=&quot;lang:default decode:true&quot;&gt;$ nginx_renabsite site_config_filename&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your app should be up and running by now.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Once you make any changes to your app, upload the files to server, then &lt;a title=&quot;Reload supervisord&quot; href=&quot;http://supervisord.readthedocs.org/en/latest/running.html#running-supervisorctl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reload Supervisor with supervisorctl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Things should be fine now. :)

P.S. - Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1225493&quot;&gt;a fabfile&lt;/a&gt; for this deployment. I haven't tried it out yet.

   <title>Instagram for Android still needs a lot of work</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/instagram-for-android-still-needs-a-lot-of-work"/>
   <updated>2012-04-04T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/instagram-for-android-still-needs-a-lot-of-work</id>
   <content type="html">Last night like everyone I downloaded Instagram for my Android phone with really high hopes. But it seems they built the app in such a hurry that they forgot to adapt to the ways an Android app works.

My friend Rajesh pointed that the bottom bar shouldn't be there always and they should make use of the menu key instead, which, strangely enough, doesn't do anything right now. Well, most users won't mind, cause I hardly needed the menu button, everything was right in front of me. 
The share button icon is different than what it usually is. That's a little trouble cause we're used to the antler-like share icon. 
Post-upload sharing is incomplete. If I choose to share the picture after upload using the share button, instead of while uploading it, choosing Twitter or Facebook will give me just the link. The caption is not included in the tweet or the Facebook post. You have to manually write it. That is not good. 
My front facing camera is not working with Instagram's own Camera app. It says picture is too small. It's strange that they would have such a filter. 
But I saw the most annoying thing this morning when I saw that there was an update for Instagram. I updated, thinking it'll fix some of the problems, but instead I found that the update size was 12mb+. That's the size of the original application! This is just embarrassing. They are yet to figure out how android apps update works! 
Don't know if it was tight schedule or incompetent developers or both, but it seems like to me that they built it in a rush. They tried to move fast and left these bugs behind. I hope they fix these problems soon.

   <title>How aware are you of what's going around you?</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/how-aware-are-you-of-whats-going-around-you"/>
   <updated>2012-04-01T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/how-aware-are-you-of-whats-going-around-you</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight I came across few youtube videos that pointed out how we tend &amp;ldquo;not to notice&amp;rdquo; things that we&amp;rsquo;re not expecting. I&amp;rsquo;ll say no more and let you watch them and see for yourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=\&quot;560\&quot; height=\&quot;420\&quot; src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ahg6qcgoay4\&quot; frameborder=\&quot;0\&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How did you like it? Feel stupid? Confused? Want to watch again? Go ahead. Once you&amp;rsquo;re satisfied realizing what just happened, watch the later one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=\&quot;560\&quot; height=\&quot;420\&quot; src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/ubNF9QNEQLA\&quot; frameborder=\&quot;0\&quot;allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Had enough fun yet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is the fact. It is just as the video says, &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss something you&amp;rsquo;re not looking for&amp;rdquo;. It can be anything from a Dancing Bear to a bear&amp;rsquo;s statue replaced by an iron armor. And if you&amp;rsquo;re not cautious enough, this might wind you up into something fatal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, keep your eyes open. :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>My Life, Nowadays.</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/726/my-life-nowadays/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/726/my-life-nowadays</id>
   <content type="html">Thing have changed a lot, since the time, almost a year back, when I wrote about &lt;a title=&quot;And They Called My Name&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/416/and-they-called-my-name/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;getting a new job&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;How Do You Leave Your Home, Again?&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/482/how-do-you-leave-your-home-again/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaving the city&lt;/a&gt;. I was all excited about going to Nagpur and staying around &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/Ramblinggeek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karthik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/AgentAkki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Akshay&lt;/a&gt; and others. But (there is Always a but) things didn't go as I planned them.&lt;!--more--&gt;

As it turned out, I needed to stay in Kolkata for some more time, or rather I *was* needed to stay here. The mental environment at home wasn't that good. Things were almost upside down. And with me gone, things might have gone pretty much in some bad way. So I decided to stay. Decided not to go to Nagpur(apologized a lot to the friends there for that). Instead started looking for a job here that could get me started and could help me pull my family out of all those troubles. With some helps from a friend, got a position into a well-known SME here.

Things were well. I started to learn Python as it was a long time due in my to-learn list and also, the job required it. And fell in love with Python. I wanted to take my time and learn it properly. But the job required me to be Fast, as, along with learning Python, I had to manage servers, databases, almost everything that was needed in a web service development team, all by myself. So I started learning it fast and I was enjoying it! Started doing overtime at home. Whole day at office, half the night at home. Barely few hours of sleep and no (time for) rest at all. And just when it shouldn't have, my health gave up.

I've always been of a little weak health. Spondilytis-like syndrome was already detected once when I was at high school. 3 years of treatment fixed me up, and stopped my outdoor sports habits. That's when I started to like computer. Few more months and I knew I couldn't live without it. Something similar happened this time too. After few weeks of above mentioned schedule, neck pain started. It got more severe by every day. Went to doctor, did an X-Ray of neck and he kind of predicted the worse. According to him, that old syndrome of mine was back and I was told to stop working sitting in front of computers for hours, for at least few months(that might expand to unknown period of time), and take rest, do exercises and etc etc.

I knew that was the end of my job. As I suddenly had to quit, right when I was most needed there(provided I was a one-man team), couldn't leave in good terms. But that needed to be done, for my own sake.

One month passed. I was maintaining all the regular exercise and stuff. I would hardly come online from PC, let alone work. But given it was me(I don't remember when was the last time I spent a day without using my PC or visit the cyber cafe when I didn't have one), I just couldn't suddenly *stop* working! Programming is everything to me. Can't spend a day without writing something, hacking something up.

So even with all those instructions from the doctor, I started being what I am. But still couldn't code or linger around for longer than few hours at a stretch.

Even though I was miserable, I couldn't ignore the problems at home. I needed to earn something. So I called up a friend. Told him I needed a work. And he also needed someone somewhat like me. No Python this time. But I got what I needed. Some work to earn me something. Enough time to rest, and learn Python(I really love it). Things have been going on like that since then.

Now things are looking good. Health is much better. Can spend less time on PC, when I'm not working, thanks to the new smartphone. Found new friends. Disconnected myself from all the previous contacts. I needed a new start. Needed to do things a new way. I figure, I was trying to get ahead of myself a year back. I remember all the foolish mistakes. Now I'm slowing down. Behaving like a 22 years old. Now all I'm looking for is an adventure. Planning to leave the city soon. Things at home are almost settled. Found friends who can accompany me in my adventure. Looking for places I can fit in. Everything is falling into places.

I'm really excited.

   <title>Education, how I wanted it to be.</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/education-how-i-wanted-it-to-be"/>
   <updated>2012-03-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/education-how-i-wanted-it-to-be</id>
   <content type="html">The other day I was chatting at &lt;a href=&quot;http://superuser.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SuperUser&lt;/a&gt; chatroom and &lt;em&gt;@studiohac&lt;/em&gt;k mentioned that he had a &lt;strong&gt;Intro-to-Mac&lt;/strong&gt; class that evening. That sounded funny as it was completely strange to me, having studied here in India. The closest subject I had to that was &quot;Introduction to Computing&quot; which was boring, and boiled down to C lessons, nothing more. I felt interested. And we started talking about how we taught ourselves.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Most of us in that chatroom at that point were self-taught. Including me. Whatever I know about computers, programming and all related things, I taught myself those. College taught me very few stuffs that I use now, but even for those we had in syllabus, I was aware of them beforehand.

Back to the topic, &lt;em&gt;@Sidran32&lt;/em&gt; started talking about how he learned things in his college -
&lt;blockquote&gt;You know, when I went to my college, they never intro'd us to Windows, Mac, or Linux/Solaris/UNIX. They just kind of threw us on Solaris machines, gave us a 1 day rudimentary overview on commands like &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, and then just let us have at it.

When I took a class that had us work on Macs in the Mac lab, there was barely anything else, other than &quot;these are the programs we're going to use, and this is how you compile in XCode&quot;. :P

It was actually kind of fun. :P If we wanted to ssh from our dorms, we were on our own. Everyone eventually figured out how to, but the teachers only gave suggestions (like putty) if we asked them after class.

Heh, there was a cracked version of xwin32 going around campus for a while. I used that until I figured out how to use cygwin, and then started experimenting with dual-booting Linux. :P&lt;/blockquote&gt;
My immediate reaction was &quot;&lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is how education should be!&quot;.

Nowadays I'm looking ahead for a masters degree. Not because it will add some more characters in my resume, just because I feel that I wasted those 4 years of mine. First year barely had any computer related subjects(Mind it that I was studying Information Technology). So, as a result, in that year, my rank was being counted from bottom. I failed a subject and was ranked second from last. :P

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We were taught how to crack exams. How to score more. So, plagiarism was considered legit. Teachers wont say so, but they hardly reacted if someone was found copying in exams. Assignments were meant for 4 to 5 students in the class. Others are supposed to copy from them. We used to stay awake the night before exam hoping that the paper would leak. We used to hide books in cloths and go to bathroom during exams to study. Apart from the fact that the syllabus is obsolete, no real life scenarios were discussed in the laboratories. Most of my batch-mates never heard of SSH(the case is still the same, although they are working in reputed Tech companies), let alone know how to use it. Version Controlling is alien to most. Software development life cycles meant waterfall model. Agile was Hebrew. Teachers would write the whole client-server communication program in C on white board so that students could copy it and vomit on the paper during exams. Handful of us knew how to debug a C code, how to trace the errors. We used to have strike in college(Shutting down college activities, classes, labs) if any of us failed in the exams. Students would lock the Principal and faculties in the college saying that students should not be failed. Those same students spent the semester at the corner of the college field smoking Gold Flake, instead of attending the class. Still it was the college's fault if they failed the exam. Hilarious. Ridiculous. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

I regret those years. If it were possible, I'd have done the same graduation in some institute where they teach the way &lt;em&gt;@Sidran32&lt;/em&gt; was taught.

I read articles where big-shot corporate gurus rant that only 10-15% of the student mass in India are employable. I wish they had spent at least 5% of their fortune in teaching these students. Where students feel challenged every single moment of those 4 years. I guess it's too much to ask.

Pity.

   <title>My Website's New Homepage</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/my-websites-new-homepage"/>
   <updated>2012-03-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/my-websites-new-homepage</id>
   <content type="html">I always get stuck when I try to find a template for my website's homepage. I've tried lot of templates, designed some myself(which sucked a lot), even tried using services like About[dot]me. But none of them truly satisfied me.&lt;!--more--&gt;

One fact about myself is that I *Love* Terminal. I Love shell. So while thinking about a theme for my homesite, it suddenly occurred to me to put a shell on my site! It's pretty damn straight. Can easily be done with Javascript. And I can very easily evolve it!(this is the part I Love most) I can put innumerable things in it. So I built &lt;a title=&quot;Bibhas.in&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.

After building it, I suddenly thought of showing it off a bit and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekli.st/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Geekli.st&lt;/a&gt; came in my mind. I've signed up for a long time there but never created a card. So went ahead and created a card - &lt;a title=&quot;Geekli.st - I've put a Shell on my website.&quot; href=&quot;http://geekli.st/iAmBibhas/ive-put-a-shell-on-my-website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I've put a Shell on my website&lt;/a&gt;. Got the first ^5 in few minutes and then within few hour it was trending! And &lt;a title=&quot;Geekli.st Trending Cards&quot; href=&quot;http://geekli.st/cards#trending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it is still(at the time of this post) trending&lt;/a&gt;! Got &lt;del&gt;5&lt;/del&gt; 6 ^5 till now. But that's enough. Enough to keep me working on it and something new. :)

1:03 AM right now. Was thinking of pulling a whole-nighter, but had a rough day and now this headache and stomach-ache is killing me. I guess I'll sleep for tonight. Just added two new stuff in the site - using the &quot;open&quot; option with &quot;blog&quot; or &quot;github&quot; command will open my blog and github profile in a new tab.

   <title>Making Skype usable on Fedora 14 and maybe later versions too</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/making-skype-usable-on-fedora-14-and-maybe-later-versions-too"/>
   <updated>2012-02-12T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/making-skype-usable-on-fedora-14-and-maybe-later-versions-too</id>
   <content type="html">I use Skype a lot. But although Skype has a fantastic version for Windows, the Linux part is a bit weak. I run Fedora 14 on my laptop(Compaq CQ42 173TU) and for some reason, Skype wont run on it. With the RPM package of 2.2 Beta, it gets installed but never runs. So I installed the static version of it following this instructions here. But when I would try to run skype from terminal, this error would occur -
[bash]
[root@localhost ~]# skype
skype: error while loading shared libraries: libXv.so.1:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[/bash]
So to check which dependency package I was missing, I searched with YUM -
[bash]
[root@localhost ~]# yum whatprovides libXv.so.1
[/bash]
and found that this specific package &lt;span class=&quot;lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;libXv-1.0.5-1.fc13.i686&lt;/span&gt; has that specific file. So although I'm running Fedora 14 and it's of x86_64 architecture, I installed that package which was meant for Fedora 13 and i686 architecture. Then ran skype from terminal and it worked!

   <title>Avail Request Object in Django Form Validation</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/avail-request-object-in-django-form-validation"/>
   <updated>2012-01-13T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/avail-request-object-in-django-form-validation</id>
   <content type="html">It may sometime happen that to validate a form field you need to check the value with some existing value from the database related to the User or some other entity. But sadly Django doesn't allow accessing the Request object in the clean() or clean_&amp;lt;FieldName&amp;gt;() methods. Here is a way around it - &lt;!--more--&gt;

All you need to do is override the default __init__() function of forms.Form with this -
[python]
def __init__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    self.request = request
    super(CreateTagForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
[/python]
Now when you call the Form, you can call it like -
[python]
form = YourForm(request, request.POST)
[/python]
Now the whole code will look like -
[python]
from django import forms

class YourForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=50, min_length=1)
    mark = forms.IntegerField(min_value=1, max_value=100)

    def __init__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        self.request = request
        super(YourForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def clean_mark(self):
        marks_left = get_marks_left(self.request.user)
        # Do what more you want to do
[/python]

That's it. Happy Coding. :)

   <title>Setup Bridged Network inside VirtualBox on Debian/Ubuntu</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/setup-bridged-network-inside-virtualbox-on-debian-ubuntu"/>
   <updated>2012-01-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/setup-bridged-network-inside-virtualbox-on-debian-ubuntu</id>
   <content type="html">I cannot stay away from Terminal. :| So I was setting up a debian box inside my Windows installation. I downloaded a net installation image of Debian 6.0.3 (&lt;a title=&quot;Direct link to the image file&quot; href=&quot;http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/debian-6.0.3-i386-netinst.iso&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;debian-6.0.3-i386-netinst.iso&lt;/a&gt;) and booted into it in VirtualBox. Well, while installing it, VB was in NAT mode and I didn't notice that. So the installer configured the OS according to NAT mode and I had the network connection after I logged in. But as I wanted to run few server applications, I needed the OS to use a bridged connection. So I opened the network configuration of VB, changed it to Bridged Adapter mode, selected by adapter, hit Ok, then restarted the network service in the box and tried to ping google. But got error. The network wasn't working.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

Fired up Google, but after few searches, I landed on the conclusion that it was the basic network configuration that I needed to follow. :|

i.e. Following commands -
[bash]
sudo  ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.5 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo route add default gw 10.0.0.1  eth0
#Now restart networking
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[/bash]

That did the trick.

   <title>PHP Console Inside Your Browser</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/php-console-inside-your-browser"/>
   <updated>2011-12-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/php-console-inside-your-browser</id>
   <content type="html">I was looking for a tool where I can write a little snippet in PHP and test it out/debug really quickly. First thought of something like these online compilers, like IDEONE. But it's too heavy for my taste. I needed something faster. Yesterday, came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://seld.be/notes/php-console-in-your-browser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Jordi Boggiano, who saved some work of mine(and lot of other developers) and made a tool that can run inside your browser, and let you run and debug PHP codes with ease, and it's also FAST.&lt;!--more--&gt;Here is a screenshot -

[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;622&quot; caption=&quot;PHP Console&quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http://seld.be/_misc/php-console.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; &quot; title=&quot;PHP Console&quot; src=&quot;http://seld.be/_misc/php-console.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;622&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]

Looks good, right? You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/seldaek/php-console&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grab the tool from github&lt;/a&gt; and use it on your localhost or your personal server, wherever you want. :)

   <title>Manage Your Cloud Server Easily Using Virtualmin</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/manage-your-cloud-server-easily-using-virtualmin"/>
   <updated>2011-11-06T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/manage-your-cloud-server-easily-using-virtualmin</id>
   <content type="html">A friend of mine owns an &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;(Amazon Web Services) account and wants to run an &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EC2&lt;/a&gt;(Elastic Compute Cloud) instance for his domain. But the problem is, he is not much technically sound to handle the Ubuntu server himself. A solution like cPanel is much better for him because then he can just click and have stuffs done, without writing a single line of command. But sadly, cPanel aint free. So is there any free alternative? I searched a bit and found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmin.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Webmin&lt;/a&gt; and its derivative &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualmin.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Virtualmin&lt;/a&gt; matches the criterion perfectly. &lt;!--more--&gt;

To make his job easy, I wrote a Python script using &lt;a href=&quot;http://fabfile.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt;, that automatically logs into his EC2 instance and installs all the packages required(e.g. lamp-server) (Will post the Fabric recipe later). I just needed to install the Virtualmin on it for him to control everything smoothly.

Virtualmin is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualmin.com/documentation/installation/manual&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bit complicated&lt;/a&gt; to setup. So they provide an installation script to make the job easy. To install Virtualmin on any server, first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualmin.com/download.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;choose the appropriate installation script from here&lt;/a&gt; for your server, then do this(I'm using the installation script for Ubuntu) -
[crayon lang=&quot;sh&quot;]
$ wget http://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh
$ sudo sh install.sh
[/crayon]

This should install Webmin, Virtualmin and configure everything.

Now, as we usually use a keypair file to SSH to cloud servers like EC2, there is no password for root user. But to login to the virtualmin interface, you'll need to set a password for the root user only for the virtualmin interface. It is NOT about setting a root password for your server's root user. This is just a password to login to virtualmin. To do that, execute this command -
[crayon lang=&quot;sh&quot;]
//For ubuntu
sudo /usr/share/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin root XYZ
//if not, then
sudo /usr/libexec/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin root XYZ
//Where XYZ is the new password
[/crayon]

Once you've done this, go visit -
[crayon lang=&quot;html&quot;]
https://example.com:10000
[/crayon]
Or:
[crayon lang=&quot;html&quot;]
https://xxx.xx.xx.xxx:10000
[/crayon]

Remember, You MUST use https. And Virtualmin is available on port 10000 by default. So remember to edit your security group(in case of Amazon AWS) to allow TCP access to port 10000.

If you've done everything right, you'll be able to see the login page of Virtualmin. Dont bother if your browser shows some warning about the validity of the SSL security when you use https, Just ignore it and proceed.

Once you login, you'll see a panel like this -

[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;448&quot; caption=&quot;Virtualmin Admin Panel&quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/IBiuF.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;    &quot; title=&quot;Virtualmin Admin Panel&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/IBiuF.png&quot; alt=&quot;Virtualmin Admin Panel&quot; width=&quot;448&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]

Now you can add Virtual Servers and configure them as much as you can. You can add virtual hosts to add domain names, setup Email servers etc etc and a lot more things.

Go ahead and give it a try. If you face any trouble, ask me or consult &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualmin.com/documentation/installation/automated&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Virtualmin's official installation guide&lt;/a&gt;.

Happy Cloud Computing. :)

   <title>WeekEndHack: The New Thing in Town!</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/weekendhack-the-new-thing-in-town"/>
   <updated>2011-08-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/weekendhack-the-new-thing-in-town</id>
   <content type="html">Ever since I came from Yahoo! Open Hack India, I've been craving for more nights like the one I had in Bangalore. Couldn't just shake that excitement off. It was too much to ignore. So I have been looking for a way to do that again.

To those who are new to this idea of Hack-nights, No this is _Not_ the usual meaning of the word &quot;Hack&quot; you come across. To us, &quot;Hack&quot; means - to build something in a very short time with whatever tools you have with you, breaking them apart and fixing them in an unique way to solve a certain purpose.

As a developer, no wonder I found it pretty interesting and was looking for a way to bring it to the town, our Kolkata, where a tech event is as rare as a Pink moon. :-/&lt;!--more--&gt;

The way was just in front of me, but I have been ignoring it for sometime. I have friends here who love programming, like me. They love developing small apps for their own use. They also share them to the world. So I started contacting them asking if they are interested in doing something like a hack-night. They seemed pretty interested, so I decided we're not going to waste times planning. So 5 of us(Me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sonthalia.umang&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Umang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/rabimba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rabimba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/golchha21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ulhas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mehulpangtey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mehul&lt;/a&gt;) just gathered up last Saturday and conduced the First ever WeekEndHack in Kolkata! I named it so because it seemed most appropriate. Also it's short enough to be a Twitter hashtag. :P

Here is a trivia of it, if last Saturday was the v1.0 of WeekEndhack, we had a beta release of it. The weekend before the last one, Me and Umang spent a night at a CCD in Sector 5 to get the idea of how it feels and how it should be. We felt that CCD is a bit out of budget for us, so the v1.0 final release was arranged a flat in South Kolkata, that belonged to a relative of Ulhas and was empty at that day. Turned out that it was perfectly OK. :)

So, as it was the first night, we spent the first half doing absolutely nothing new. We just put up a facebook page and a website for ourselves. You can visit them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/WeekEndHack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weekendhack.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Then as the night started fading, ideas seemed to pour onto us. We were coming up with one idea after another. Each of them were more interesting than the previous one. We mostly depended on Umang to decide the feasibility of the idea as he has a good knowledge about the current web market and apps. And when the sun was almost out, we found the gem we've gathered for. For some obvious reasons I'm unable to disclose the details right now, but you'll see some fruit out of it pretty soon. :)

As we were almost out of time, we couldn't finish building a prototype for it, so we saved it for the next WeekEndHack, which we're planning to hold on 3rd September.  Till then, we're working on the website, and the facebook page and trying to connect to as many passionate minds as possible. We've got about 5-6 requests till now. I'm guessing the next one will be larger than the first one. :)

And to add more to it, I'm trying to get some sponsor for it. Almost decided on one. A startup has agreed to give us some space to work at. :) I'll publish more details on the website itself. So keep an eye on the website. The address is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weekendhack.in/&quot;&gt;WeekEndHack.in&lt;/a&gt; .

I'm looking forward to my friends in other cities to start the same thing at their home town itself. Chennai and Bangalore already has such events. But we are asking people from cities like Kolkata to start this, where tech events rarely happens. And I planned on doing this every alternate Saturday because I want people to get used to the idea. The main motto is to bring out the hidden passionate people out of the crowd, those who either don't know any way to reach out to people about their ideas or thinks that doing so is impossible here in Kolkata.

So we'll keep this up. If you've found the idea interesting, do contact me and Join us. We're looking for your participation that can make the image of the city better in front of the world. :)

This logo was designed by Ron Wayne, the designer of Apple Inc at that time. The logo features Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was inspired by a quotation by Wordsworth that was also inscribed into the logo that said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Newton… A Mind Forever Voyaging Through Strange Seas of Thought... Alone.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Chrome: Instant Desktop Notification of Your Google Reader Feed</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/chrome-instant-desktop-notification-of-your-google-reader-feed"/>
   <updated>2011-05-16T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/chrome-instant-desktop-notification-of-your-google-reader-feed</id>
   <content type="html">I know there are hell lot of people out there(like me) who are too lazy to open &lt;a title=&quot;Google Reader&quot; href=&quot;http://reader.google.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://reader.google.com&lt;/a&gt; every time for latest news, yet want to stay updated of the news instantly. I made a simple solution for myself.&lt;!--more--&gt;The logic is simple. I'm going to fetch the public feed of my reader timeline and going to put that in a Chrome app that shows desktop notifications instantly for any feed. :)

I installed a Chrome app named &lt;a title=&quot;Feed Notifier&quot; href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/njjncilebadhdbgkgnnbobcofhgjmipj?hl=en-US&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Feed Notifier&lt;/a&gt;. After installing it, just go to &lt;strong&gt;Menu&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tools&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Extensions&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;gt; Click on the &lt;strong&gt;Options&lt;/strong&gt; link below &lt;strong&gt;Feed Notifier&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/AsBYT.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Feed notifier&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/AsBYT.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;720&quot; height=&quot;405&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Now keep that window open, we need to get your Reader feed now.

Open &lt;a title=&quot;Google Reader&quot; href=&quot;http://reader.google.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Reader&lt;/a&gt;. Go to All Items. Then copy the URL of that window. it should be something like -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:html&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/reader/view/#stream/user%2F08435596288051107451%2Fstate%2Fcom.google%2Freading-list&lt;/pre&gt;
Now change that URL a bit. To something like this -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:html&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/reader/atom/user%2F08435596288051107451%2Fstate%2Fcom.google%2Freading-list&lt;/pre&gt;
So you see, I just replaced &lt;strong&gt;/view/#stream/&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;/atom/&lt;/strong&gt; ..

Now copy the new modified URL, paste it in the &lt;strong&gt;Feed URL&lt;/strong&gt; field of the Feed Notifier extension window you opened earlier. Set refresh interval and other options. Click Save. And that's it. Now you should be able to see desktop notifications like this every time a new item appears in your Google Reader stream. :)

&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;Feed Notifier&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/JdJDH.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;341&quot; height=&quot;258&quot; /&gt;

   <title>Only Domain Name Is Not Enough</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/only-domain-name-is-not-enough"/>
   <updated>2011-05-07T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/only-domain-name-is-not-enough</id>
   <content type="html">There was a time when a domain name was enough for any business or product for their web presence. We were happy with &lt;a title=&quot;McAfee&quot; href=&quot;http://www.McAfee.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.McAfee.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon&quot; href=&quot;http://www.Amazon.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; .. But the scenario is different now. It seems we can't be satisfied with just the domain name now. We also want &lt;a title=&quot;McAfee Twitter&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/McAfee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@McAfee&lt;/a&gt; or @&lt;a title=&quot;Amazon on Twitter&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Amazon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Or rather those brands need them even more than a website now.

I recently tried out a forum website &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.androidhelps.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AndroidHelps.com&lt;/a&gt; and someone referred me to &lt;a title=&quot;Woorank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.woorank.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WooRank.com&lt;/a&gt; to check some rank and stuff about the website. So, there I noticed that they also check the twitter handle on the given domain name for calculating rank! I immediately went to twitter and registered the handle &lt;a title=&quot;AndroidHelps&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/AndroidHelps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@AndroidHelps&lt;/a&gt; .. And now I've ensured that when (and If) my site (ever) become popuplar, i'll have the web covered with a website, a blog and a twitter account.

So, things have come to this. We're so much into twitter now(not everyone though, but those who 'make' things popular, always keep an eye on their timeline), that we cannot think about advertising or promoting a brand without a twitter account. The equation is now, No. of Followers is proportional to the popularity of the service or product. Maybe one or two of you will disagree, but be sure, a hundred more will be agreeing as they read this.

   <title>Modifying MySQL Database using C#.NET</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/modifying-mysql-database-using-c-net"/>
   <updated>2011-05-07T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/modifying-mysql-database-using-c-net</id>
   <content type="html">To modify MySQL databases using C#.NET or any language using .NET framework, you must first install the MySQL Connector for .NET. You can download it &lt;a title=&quot;MySQL Connectors for .NET&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;from here&lt;/a&gt;. Avoid v6.3.6 for now, as I've discussed in &lt;a title=&quot;MySQL’s Connector for .NET v6.3.6 has bugs it seems&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/2011/05/mysqls-connector-for-net-v6-3-6-has-bugs-it-seems/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a previous post&lt;/a&gt;, that version might have some bugs. Go the the &lt;a title=&quot;Connector/NET Previous Versions Download&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/net/6.2.html#downloads&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;previous versions section&lt;/a&gt; and download v6.3.4 instead. After you've downloaded it, install.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Now run Visual Studio. Open your project. Go to &lt;em&gt;View&lt;/em&gt; menu &amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Solution Explorer&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; right click on &lt;em&gt;References&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Add References&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; under the tab &lt;em&gt;.NET&lt;/em&gt;, select &lt;em&gt;MySQL.Data &lt;/em&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;em&gt;Ok&lt;/em&gt;. That's almost it. Now you've added the reference to your project.

To start coding, add this line to the top of your source -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:csharp&quot;&gt;using MySql.Data.MySqlClient;&lt;/pre&gt;
Now you can write the codes just like you do with &lt;em&gt;SQL server&lt;/em&gt;, just add My in front of SQL :P. See the code below for example. I wrote two abstract function for my use.
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:csharp&quot;&gt;private string MySQLConnectionString = &quot;SERVER=localhost;DATABASE=db_name;UID=root;PASSWORD=;&quot;;
public int mysql_query_execute_noReturn(string query)
{
    Int32 row_affected = 0;
    try
    {
        MySqlConnection con = new MySqlConnection(MySQLConnectionString);
        if (con.State == System.Data.ConnectionState.Closed)
        {
            con.Open();
        }
        MySqlCommand command = new MySqlCommand(query, con);
        row_affected = command.ExecuteNonQuery();

        if (con.State == System.Data.ConnectionState.Open)
        {
            con.Close();
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {

    }
    return row_affected;
}

public DataSet mysql_query_execute_return(string query)
{
    DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();
    try
    {
        MySqlConnection con = new MySqlConnection(MySQLConnectionString);
        if (con.State == System.Data.ConnectionState.Closed)
        {
            con.Open();
        }
        MySqlDataAdapter dataAdapter = new MySqlDataAdapter(query, con);
        dataAdapter.Fill(dataSet);
        if (con.State == System.Data.ConnectionState.Open)
        {
            con.Close();
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {

    }
    return dataSet;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
You can pass any query string to these functions, &lt;em&gt;mysql_query_execute_noReturn&lt;/em&gt; will take a query, execute it and return the number of rows affected. It's only for queries like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc. And &lt;em&gt;mysql_query_execute_return&lt;/em&gt; will take a query, execute it and return a &lt;em&gt;DataSet &lt;/em&gt;containing all the records. It's for queries like SELECT.

So, try it out. :)

   <title>MySQL's Connector for .NET v6.3.6 has bugs it seems</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/mysqls-connector-for-net-v6-3-6-has-bugs-it-seems"/>
   <updated>2011-05-06T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/mysqls-connector-for-net-v6-3-6-has-bugs-it-seems</id>
   <content type="html">My final year project requires both the use of .NET and PHP/MySQL. For some certain process, I needed to connect to the MySQL database from the .NET desktop app.&lt;!--more--&gt; So I searched a bit and saw that MySQL provides several connectors to connect to MySQL database using various languages or platforms, e.g. there are connectors for ODBC(for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and Unix platforms), Java platform, .NET platform, MXJ(MBean for embedding the MySQL server in Java applications), C and C++ language and even for OpenOffice.org products! Seemed cool. went ahead and downloaded the latest stable version 6.3.6 of the .NET connector. But when I tried to install it, the installation failed unexpectedly. There were no error log for me to analyze and take step. Only this error message from the installer -

[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;510&quot; caption=&quot;MySQL Connector/NET installation error&quot;]&lt;img title=&quot;MySQL Connector/NET installation error&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/YWBX6.png&quot; alt=&quot;MySQL Connector/NET installation error&quot; width=&quot;510&quot; height=&quot;397&quot; /&gt;[/caption]

Now I searched for the solution, went to the MySQL dev forum, but couldn't find a solution that worked. So I assumed that this installer is faulty, hence downloaded the immediate previous version 6.3.4 and tried to install it. Now it installed without any problem. Tried connecting from the .NET app, worked cool.

So it's pretty much clear that the 6.3.6 installer has some glitch that needs to be worked on. Hope they fix it soon.

   <title>Validating Regular Expression</title>

   <updated>2011-04-29T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/validating-regular-expression</id>
   <content type="html">One of my basic beliefs - Regular Expression is God-Gifted.. Its hard to find something that can be so simple but so much useful.. All for these reasons, I end up using RegEx whenever I have some pattern matching business. And for that to be perfect, I need a cool RegEx validator.

&lt;!--more--&gt;Most of the times, I use the validator from &lt;a title=&quot;GSkinner&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gskinner.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GSkinner&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a title=&quot;RegExr&quot; href=&quot;http://gskinner.com/RegExr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://gskinner.com/RegExr/&lt;/a&gt; ..
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/rgBYG.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter&quot; title=&quot;RegExp&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/rgBYG.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;808&quot; height=&quot;382&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It's built with flash. Have a cool interface. There are a lot of inbuilt patters you can use or try out. You can also save your own patterns.

It have options to test both matching of patterns and replacing using patterns.

And to add to all this, it has a desktop version you can &lt;a title=&quot;RegExr Desktop&quot; href=&quot;http://www.gskinner.com/RegExr/desktop/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt; and use right away! Sweet! :)

   <title>How Do You Leave Your Home, Again?</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/how-do-you-leave-your-home-again"/>
   <updated>2011-04-26T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/how-do-you-leave-your-home-again</id>
   <content type="html">Received my &lt;a title=&quot;And They Called My Name&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/2011/02/and-they-called-my-name/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;appointment letter&lt;/a&gt; last night. Will be joining Persistent Systems Ltd as a Software Engineer. Have to leave for Nagpur in September..

&lt;!--more--&gt;

This will be my third time leaving a hometown and shifting to another. And it wasn't easy the first two times. Wondering how I'm going to manage this time..

First time I left shifted from one city to another, I was a little kid of 7-8 years. So almost felt nothing as I had new enjoyments, new toys to play with in the new city. Second time, it was a bit hard. Left all my relatives, my cousins, my school friends. But as I found later, I'm extremely good in adapting with a new situation. I can blend in to a new environment really fast. Without anyone noticing it. So handled it somehow.

But, what about this time?

Its different. I have to leave my city, the City of Joy, away from my family, friends, inspirations, my love.. How can I adjust without them..?

I'm hoping for the best till now. For years, I've made friends with people around the country. I've been friends with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.karthikrewired.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://chetangole.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;great&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.akshul.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; from Nagpur. I'm hoping that I'll be just fine with them around.

But still.. How.. Can't figure. Leaving things to the hands of time. Lets see.
&lt;blockquote&gt;P.S. - Sorry for getting all emotional.. But can not help. :(&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Google's +1 Button and My View on it</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/googles-1-button-and-my-view-on-it"/>
   <updated>2011-04-01T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/googles-1-button-and-my-view-on-it</id>
   <content type="html">Google recently introduced a new feature to be used with their search engine, sort of a plugin you can say, calling it the +1 button.. Now those of us who use internet forums, know very well what is the value of those two letters -&amp;gt; +1. Google took that idea and implemented it in their search engine.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Google says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sometimes it’s easier to find exactly what you’re looking for when someone you know already found it. Get recommendations for the things that interest you, right when you want them, in your search results.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So, basically it works like a recommendation system. You can also put the +1 button on your website and ask the visitors to +1 it if they like it.

Now according to Google, this +1 is going to also affect your search results. Google is going to store the recommendation of the people from your network and give those results preferences that others.. Ummm, but wait, what do they mean by people in your network? As they mentioned, it means -
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People in your Gmail (or Google Talk) chat list.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People in your My Contacts group in Google Contacts.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;People you’re following in Google Reader and Google Buzz.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Now that's interesting..

It means that, if some people from your *network* starts spamming with the +1 button(which is quite possible with the number of SEOs, pseudo-SEOs and Punks around), you'll start missing good results.. That is real concern.

Well, one solution that I thought should be considered, it to introduce a -1 button too.. Meaning that you can prioritize and deprioritize your results according to your choice.. With only +1 button, you'll have to +1 almost 9 search results if you want an unwanted result to be removed which is at position one.. That's lame.. :-/

   <content type="html">This is something new I saw today.

While posting a comment in Facebook, for some unknown reason, it couldn't be posted so facebook showed an error message and also provided a &quot;Try Again&quot; button!

   <content type="html">I've been added to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=27363419159&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;KWS Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; for sometime. And being an amateur(read nOOb) photographer, I always wanted to meet others who are just like me or more expert and learn from them. Hence a photowalk was always welcome to me. So when I learned that KWS is going to hold a photowalk at West Bengal State Handicraft Expo 2011 at Milan Mela ground, I really wanted to join and started poking &lt;a class=&quot;aptureEnhance&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/cybercool10/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kuntal&lt;/a&gt; for his secondary camera(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/cameras/nikon/coolpix_p90/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nikon Coolpix P90&lt;/a&gt;) for a day as I don't have a camera myself. Well, luckily Kuntal managed it somehow and on that day, we went to the venue together.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

We were supposed to meet in front of the Science city gate on EM Bypass. But me and Kuntal were a bit late, so we couldn't find anyone there and decided to enter the fair. I've already implied that fact that this was my first photowalk with KWS, everyone was stranger to me. But Kuntal seemed to know some of them and noticed where they are the moment we entered the fair, all I saw was a bunch of people with cameras in their hands and only one almost-known face, that was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/prasundutta/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Prasun da&lt;/a&gt;(recognized him from his Flickr account DP). Although I heard about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/anirbanbrahma/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anirban Brahma&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/dasumit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/sanjibc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;friends&lt;/a&gt; who personally know him, but we never met before.

The fair premise was pretty huge for a fair like that. And the sun was almost above head as it was about 2pm. I felt myself that the light was too harsh for capturing something outdoor. So we started wandering around just to pass the time and let the sun drop a li'l bit.

As time passed, more and more people started gathering for KWS. I was wondering how many exactly are gonna turn up. And the number wasn't small. Wherever I went, I saw a face from KWS and some more people with cameras who weren't with us.

So I took out that camera of mine, and started capturing. This was the first time I was using a P90(I usually use a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/cameras/canon/powershot_s5_is/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canon S5-IS&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1594893313&amp;amp;sk=photos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;another friend&lt;/a&gt;), so took some time to familiarize myself with it.
There were a LOT to capture. The fair was full of subjects - drawings, ornaments, decorative stuffs and (my personal favorite) People!

Lot of people, everyone was busy. The vendors were working on their show-pieces, one artist was drawing a portrait of a girl, the kids of the vendors were playing around, the people who came to the fair were busy bargaining, other photographers were capturing things with interesting poses etc etc..

Suddenly saw &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/sahaanirbannew?sk=photos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Anirban Saha&lt;/a&gt; there. I didn't actually know that he was a semi-regular with KWS. He was shooting interesting stuff too. Showed me some, liked 'em.

In a gist, it was a pretty interesting place when you've got a camera with you. I didn't even realize when the time was up, sun was setting and suddenly the group members started calling for me, I get that its the group pic time. Now here I met everyone that were present that day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/amitavaghosh/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amitava&lt;/a&gt; told us an interesting story where he was held by police for capturing photos, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrigankabanerjee/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mriganka&lt;/a&gt; was a all-smile boy, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/abhijit_jabberwocky/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abhijit&lt;/a&gt; and Anirban were calling for those who weren't present and a LOT of things.. The number was pretty high, about 27. It's a KWS attendance record I think. When we gathered up, I got some new faces to capture. Posted one(of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/tania_sarcar/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tania Sarcar&lt;/a&gt;) in the KWS pool. Anyway, we got a great group pic. You can see it below(I'm the second right standing one with white t-shirt :).

&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; title=&quot;Kolkata Weekend Shoots Members&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ErM8c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;544&quot; /&gt;

The later plan was to go visit China town and have some snacks, but It would've been a li'l bit overkill for my pocket, so decided to head back for home. Kuntal was also up for returning home. So we left saying good bye to all those who stayed.

Now I should write a conclusion. But I can't find any. The only thing in my mind is the next KWS meet. Waiting for another rocking day. :)

   <title>Selective/Conditional Update with Yum</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/selective-conditional-update-with-yum"/>
   <updated>2011-02-26T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/selective-conditional-update-with-yum</id>
   <content type="html">The first thing I noticed after installing Fedora 14 was that there are updates available for my packages. And not a few, more than 400 updates! Sizing about 500mb!

Now, I use a lame internet plan of 256kbps. Updating all the packages in one go will make me keep this system on for about 5 hours. Thats not possible for me. So I needed a way to update few packages everytime and keep doing that whenever I find time.&lt;!--more--&gt;Now I can open the update manager, untick about 350 package the first time to update first 50 package and go on like that.. Sounds ridiculous, right? So ticking-unticking aint an option, lets look for something new.

Terminal is always there, lets use it. I thought of using conditions with the &lt;strong&gt;yum&lt;/strong&gt; command. Like defining a number, so that first that number of packages will be updated. But that'd most probably require me to write a complicated shell script which I'm not intending to do right now.

Next option, lets try to find if any condition can be applied to packages' name and update only the matching ones. This idea seem to have an easy way to deploy. I found that you can use wildcard (*) to the &lt;strong&gt;yum update&lt;/strong&gt; command. Now that's cool! it lets me to select packages based on a portion of their name. Like, if I want to update only the packages that start with a, all I need to do is use this command -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;# yum update a*
&lt;/pre&gt;
Or if I want to update all the packages that has the phrase py in them, I'd use the command -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;# yum update *py*
&lt;/pre&gt;
I can also define more than one condition with a space as delimiter, like -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;# yum update 'a*' '*bas*'
&lt;/pre&gt;
That's it! I got my way to update few packages at a time. :D
&lt;blockquote&gt;Note: Before using Yum, install the yum plugin &lt;strong&gt;yum-fastestmirror&lt;/strong&gt;. Saves time finding the the mirrors that'll transfer data faster. :)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Install Adobe Flash Player 10.2 on Fedora 14 x86_64</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/install-adobe-flash-player-10-2-on-fedora-14-x86-64"/>
   <updated>2011-02-25T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/install-adobe-flash-player-10-2-on-fedora-14-x86-64</id>
   <content type="html">Reading the title may make you feel it's pretty simple - Download the flash player rpm package from adobe.com, install it and Done. I thought so too. But even if flash-plugin was installed, Firefox wasn't detecting it. So did some old-style googling, and came up with these commands.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Remember, my one is Fedora 14 x86_64, it might not work for other versions.
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1. Open Terminal and go to Root user mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;
su -
Enter password: &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2. Install Adobe YUM Repository RPM package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;rpm -ivh http://linuxdownload.adobe.com/adobe-release/adobe-release-i386-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-adobe-linux
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3. Update Repositories(Optional, Do if you haven't done it recently)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;yum check-update&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4. Install required packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;yum install flash-plugin nspluginwrapper.x86_64 nspluginwrapper.i686 alsa-plugins-pulseaudio.i686 libcurl.i686&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This command should also work on &lt;strong&gt;Fedora 13, Fedora 12 and Red Hat (RHEL) 6 64-bit version (x86_64) (32 bit wrapped version)&lt;/strong&gt;..&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That's it. Restart Firefox and you should be able to run Flash stuff. Head for Youtube to test it.

Yesterday (20th Feb '11) was a day full of fun and cheers coming from each and everyone.. Two Major bloggers' meet on a single day. Heck, whattay day it was!

At the indiBlogger meet, there was a social networking session, where everyone has been given a white paper which they can hang on their back and go to other people, talk to them, introduce self and ask for a comment.. It was a really interesting session. Loved it. My piece of paper was full of comments written by people I hardly know, and also some people I'm lucky to know.. I'm gonna share the comments here, because I want to remember them. For an eternity..&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone: &lt;strong&gt;Bibhas(in Bengali), meeting you was an experience.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>And They Called My Name</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/and-they-called-my-name"/>
   <updated>2011-02-06T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/and-they-called-my-name</id>
   <content type="html">This blog post is only for me  to remember that what happened, was the last thing I expected..&lt;!--more--&gt;

5th  February, 2011. I woke up like any other day, early, to go for my driving lessons, drove pretty well, returned home expecting my friend Nishan to call me and say that I was late. We were supposed to leave early for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nsec.ac.in&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Netaji Subhas Engg College&lt;/a&gt; for our campusing process with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.persistentsys.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Persistent Systems Ltd&lt;/a&gt;. Well, eventually, we both were late. But I tried to keep up with the schedule. Got ready really fast. In my mind, I was going for an outing. Was pretty sure I'm not gonna clear the aptitude test among all those 800+ students. So I didnt wear my blazer, I didnt shave, didnt wear a good shirt. And left for the destination.

We reached the college, waited for about 2 hours as there were already half of the number inside the college appearing the test. When that batch came out, my friends were all asking them what were all the question, how to answer the tough ones. Some started revising quick. I was just standing there, planning to go to the book fair after we appear in the written test.

So our time came, we entered the hall, first the aptitude question paper was distributed. It had 60 MCQs. I had 1 hour in hand. And the question were pretty easy. So attended about 57. I was 100% sure about 50-53 of them. Then after the hour, came the subjective paper. It had a C program, which asked the students to write a program to read another C source file and remove all the commented lines from it. And there was another question asking the students to explain a sentence. Something about India being a field of opportunity or something. I dont remember because I didn't even think of attending it. I knew the algo required for the C program. I was just lacking some syntaxes(its been really long since I tried C). But I thought, WTH! I can make up syntaxes with ease. :P

So started writing the code, and where it was a bit complex, kept commenting them. after half an hour, they took the paper, I submitted it with a lot of bugs, but the maintained the logic. Left the room and the waiting started. :-/

They were supposed to declare the result in about half an hour. But it took them about 2 hours in total to come up with the names!! During then, I was planning to visit Book fair and South City mall with my friends. And was waiting when they'd declare the result, so that we can leave early..

Then after sometime, which seemed like an year to me, they appeared in front of us and started reading the names.

5 names, 10 names, 15 names, 20 names, 25 names ... And on the 28th, I heard something like &quot;Bibhas Chandra Debnath from Narula Institute of Technology&quot;.. I was one of the 33 who cleared the aptitude test. And my friends were like &quot;Woooooot&quot;! And the first word I spoke was WT&lt;strong&gt;F, &lt;/strong&gt;excluding the &lt;strong&gt;WT&lt;/strong&gt; part.. :-/

&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Later part of the story&lt;/span&gt; - They had 3 interviews(Two technical round and one HR round). The first technical round was supposed to start from 6:30. But it started at 9:30 for me. (Remember, I didn't have lunch. :-/) then they called me, went and answered all the questions which were on basic of C, DS and some theories on Windows. Then again started waiting for the 1st round result.. I was so exhausted that I was ready to leave before the 1st round result was declared. But then suddenly they came, asked me to go for the 2nd round.. I was again like wtf!..

Went anyway. Answered all the questions related to my projects. Asked them something about the slides they showed me, and left. Again started waiting. Then they came with a form and said that I cleared the 2nd technical round. :| And was asked to appear in the HR round.. Appeared. The HR asked me to wait half an hour for the final result.

After half an hour, it was almost 12 midnight. The HR came out, with 7 envelops. Announced 6 names. then suddenly called my name.!. Another wtf moment people.. And said, &quot;See you in Nagpur.&quot; .. I was smiling.. What else could I do? The only thing that came in my mind was, &quot;I *did not* come here for all these and I couldn't go to the Book fair with my friends..&quot; :(
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333;&quot;&gt;P.S. - Just to complete the story, only these 7 were selected finally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>A Fedora Day at GCECT, Kolkata</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/a-fedora-day-at-gcect-kolkata"/>
   <updated>2011-02-04T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/a-fedora-day-at-gcect-kolkata</id>
   <content type="html">Kolkata is usually not very frequent when it comes to organizing Tech related events. mostly because that crowd is very small every time someone tries something. But despite that, I've been trying to attend as many events possible and bring then together, so that everytime we can have atleast some new faces. That is actually how the crowd grows.

So when I came to know about this &quot;Fedora 14 Realease Party&quot; on 2nd February via Facebook, I was interested and despite some trouble, went ahead and attended it. And I must say, It's been a memory to remember for sometime. :)&lt;!--more--&gt;

The main attraction of the event for me was the speech from Mr. Indranil Das Gupta and the proposed speech on 'KDE-EDU : Using, Learning, Contributing' by Mrs Stephenie Das Gupta. The main reason was that I've known Indranil da from sometimes now, but could never attend his speech and I really wanted to. And for Stephenie, I've seen her in *action* before, but never had the chance to get familiar to her. So here was my chance. :)

The venue, Government College of Engineering &amp;amp; Ceramic Technology or GCECT, is a well known Govt Engineering college in West Bengal. They had a big space. But however might the event have been, I have to give them kudos for they had a good number of students attend the seminar. More would have been netter, but I think they'll learn from this event.

For some problems in the college during the event, only the speech By Indranil da was performed, and the speech by Stephenie had to be discarded. But I have to say, I enjoyed Indranil da's speech. He actually knew how to engage the type of students that were sitting infront of him and he proceeded that way. I loved the way he demonstrated that how we're all one way or another using Free and Open Source Softwares or FOSS, and How we're going to realize their importance when we actually run out of them. One little example of this was his &quot;Breath-Holding&quot; experiment(I made up the name :P ). He asked a girl from the audience and a boy with a wrist watch. Then he asked the girl to hold her breath as long as she can. That boy had the count, she could hold it for about 40 seconds. And had to give up as it was impossible for her to continue without air.. Now compare the Air with the FOSS we're using in our daily life, we're using them even not knowing when we're doing that, just like we breath. And once we run out of them, we're definitely gonna suffocate.

For people interested in how to earn through FOSS, he gave some interesting live examples of how people are already doing that and earning even more then the ones not working with FOSS. I'll talk about it more later.

Although this was supposed to be a &quot;Fedora Release Party&quot;, it actually ended up being a &quot;Fedora Activity Day&quot; as Fedora 14 was released exactly 3 months before the event, and it was unethical to call it a release party. :) I left early, so I didnt get the Fedora 14 disc, but I'm sure the other attendants got theirs. :)

Here are some pics from the event. Might give you a picture of what happened. :)

   <title>PHP Enthusiast? Discover new Functions Right on Your Timeline/wall</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/php-enthusiast-discover-new-functions-right-on-your-timelinewall"/>
   <updated>2011-01-20T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/php-enthusiast-discover-new-functions-right-on-your-timelinewall</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;img class=&quot;alignright&quot; title=&quot;PHPrefX&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/zUcIf.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;Being a PHP developer myself, I know how hard a work might get if you don't know about functions that are appropriate to the situation. So, I thought of building a service that will let people discover new functions everyday, right on their wall(in case of Facebook) or timeline(in case of Twitter).

So I built &lt;strong&gt;PHPrefX&lt;/strong&gt;. A service that keeps posting the name of a function, a short info and the link to the reference of that function once every hour on Twitter and Facebook.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear: both;&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--more--&gt;

If people show interests, I will add an email subscription system too. But that's for a near future. :)

For Twitter users, Please follow @&lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/phprefx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phprefx&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook users can head for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://on.fb.me/PHPrefX&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fan page of PHPrefX&lt;/a&gt;.

And DO let me know if you like it and if you need any changes made. :)

   <title>Year Ending Meetup - Tweets</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/year-ending-meetup-tweets"/>
   <updated>2010-12-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/year-ending-meetup-tweets</id>
   <content type="html">We decided to meet up once before the year ends and have a quality time. Some of us are gonna tweet live from the spot. So I thought this would help to track the tweets. :)
So, its just a Live stream for following the tweets made from the Event spot. :)

   <title>Customize Wordpress' Automated Permalink Generation</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/customize-wordpress-automated-permalink-generation"/>
   <updated>2010-12-24T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/customize-wordpress-automated-permalink-generation</id>
   <content type="html">If you use Wordpress for managing your blog or CMS, then you know how it automatically generate the permalink of a post when you just provide the title of the post. It takes the Title, removes special characters or replaces them with a hyphen(-).

Now, I was working on a project which required a news submission to Google news, for which I needed to fix an arbitrary 3 or more digit number to the permalink(Google requirement). So one way of doing that was to manually edit it each time i wrote a post. But that aint possible considering the frequency of posting. So I had to automate the process. &lt;!--more--&gt;So I looked around a bit, had &lt;a class=&quot;aptureEnhance&quot; href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4518527/customize-the-auto-generation-of-post-slug-in-wordpress/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a healthy conversation in StackOverflow&lt;/a&gt; but it didn't work well. So, when I was wandering around the &lt;a class=&quot;aptureEnhance&quot; href=&quot;http://phpxref.ftwr.co.uk/wordpress/nav.html?wp-admin/includes/post.php.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;post.php&lt;/a&gt; file, I noticed a function named &lt;em&gt;wp_unique_post_slug()&lt;/em&gt; which seemed like the solution I needed! That function generates the slug of the post when the post title is passed to it.

Here is the total function -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: php&quot;&gt;function wp_unique_post_slug( $slug, $post_ID, $post_status, $post_type, $post_parent ) {
	// A Whole Lot of Stuff is done here.. But what we really need is the final line ..
        // ....
        return $slug;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
So, Just before the generated slug is returned from the function, I made the necessary changes. Like -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: php&quot;&gt;if($slug!=&quot;&quot;){
  $random=rand(11111,99999); //I needed 5 digit random
  $slug .= &quot;-&quot; . $random;
}
return $slug;&lt;/pre&gt;
And Tada! My Job Done. So now if I give a post title like &quot;&lt;strong&gt;Hello World&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;, for a default Wordpress installation, the permalink generated would be - &lt;strong&gt;http://bibhas.in/blog/2010/12/hello-world/&lt;/strong&gt; but with my customization, I'd get a permalink like &lt;strong&gt;http://bibhas.in/blog/2010/12/hello-world-34523/&lt;/strong&gt; .. Where the number &lt;strong&gt;34523&lt;/strong&gt; is a random number generated by my added code. :)

So this way, you can make changes in your slug any way you want. But be careful when you edit the file. One mistake can literally Hang your blog. :P

   <title>Been Wondering Why Facebook Doesn't Have a 'Dislike' Button?</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/been-wondering-why-facebook-doesnt-have-a-dislike-button"/>
   <updated>2010-12-10T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/been-wondering-why-facebook-doesnt-have-a-dislike-button</id>
   <content type="html">Saw some really Lame posts in Facebook and thought there should be a 'dislike' button?

Well, think again.
&lt;!--more--&gt;

Lets face the facts. Facebook is a site for growing your network. Your network necessarily means the people you like and feel comfortable with. (Well, its not always the case. People often keep adding people they dont even intend to communicate. That's definitely Lame.)
Now, in this scenario, introducing a “Dislike” button would also come with some basic social problems.

Ever heard of “Bullying”? Clicking the dislike button is like Bullying over someone. Why? because you’re not even showing reason for disliking. If someone dislike your post, of course you’ll get offended. Its like Someone Shouting in front of a whole bunch of people that he Hates you. (Well, you can understand what people will think about both of you after that.)
If you dont like something, just tell him that directly *with reasons* or just ignore it. When someone publicly dislikes your post, you lose a good amount of respect from others who can see it. (Think about that.)

And also, You think disliking someone else's post would be Cool? Just give it a thought, How'd You feel if someone dislikes Your post?

I think that’ll be enough. I made my point.

   <title>Build your own IRC bot in PHP</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/209/build-your-own-irc-bot-in-php/"/>
   <updated>2010-11-17T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/209/build-your-own-irc-bot-in-php</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started using IRC about 2 months ago. I know its lame of me to get to that stuff so late. But from the very point I logged into a channel, the thing that caught most of my attention was a Bot that used to respond to user command. Now that seemed interesting. I dug some codes in Github, did some Googling and got the idea. Then found a sample snippet of how to create an IRC bot with PHP, at www.thegeeks.us which wasn&amp;rsquo;t much functional to start with.. I started testing the code and thanks to Ben(spookz), one of the member(and most probably a co-founder too) of thegeeks.us, with some &lt;em&gt;inspiration&lt;/em&gt; from him, I got this thing to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I built quite a few commands for myself. But I&amp;rsquo;d rather not post them in a blog which is pretty much in Google&amp;rsquo;s reach. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am posting the code here so that you can customize it and build your own bot with it. The code itself is documented with comments. Still, if you have any type of doubt, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*
* PHP IRC Bot
* Customized by Bibhas.
* Get in touch at @pythonerd in twitter

//Setting time limit off. We need to run the script until We ask it to exit.
set_time_limit(0);
//Open socket to server,port
$socket = fsockopen(&quot;irc.freenode.net&quot;,6667);
//Sends USER HOSTNAME IDENT :REAL NAME Change it as you wish.
fputs($socket,&quot;USER PHPBot bibhas.in PHP :The PHP Bot\n&quot;);

//Sends the NICK to server. Choose a unique one or the script will fail.
fputs($socket,&quot;NICK php-bot-custom\n&quot;);

//Enter the channel you want to use your bot on.
fputs($socket,&quot;JOIN #sample-channel\n&quot;);

//Array of commands you can use. If you create a new command,
//it must be enlisted here before it can be used.
$commands = array (
&quot;!version&quot;,

while (1) {

    //Recieves the data into $data in 128 bytes.
    //The bot actually does nothing but receive data users enter in the channel and
    //respond to it. So, we'll fetch all the texts entered in the channel and
    //fetch our required data and respond to it.
    while($data=fgets($socket,128)) {
        //puts the data in an array by word
        //this helps us to identify commands and parameters

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To run the bot:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run it from either command prompt with php and  Apache server installed or you can run it from a browser. For the later case, just execute the script file form the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go. Leave comment if you have doubt. Or directly reach me at twitter or facebook. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:Note to myself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code looks like a mess. Clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Auto Refresh your Dabr client</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/193/auto-refresh-your-dabr-client/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-31T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/193/auto-refresh-your-dabr-client</id>
   <content type="html">If you don't know yet, Dabr is an open source Twitter Mobile Web client which can be used from their own site &lt;a title=&quot;Dabr Home Page&quot; href=&quot;http://dabr.co.uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;dabr.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; or you can download the code from its &lt;a title=&quot;Dabr code&quot; href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/dabr/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Code page&lt;/a&gt; and upload it to your server and use it like your own client.. :) But Don't forget to read the documentation while installing. :)

Now, about auto refreshing, First I thought about using AJAX, but that seemed a lot of work. So, I thought of an alternative.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Open the &lt;strong&gt;theme.php&lt;/strong&gt; file which is inside the &lt;strong&gt;common&lt;/strong&gt; directory.
Scroll to line no &lt;strong&gt;137&lt;/strong&gt;. You should see something like this -&amp;gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;',$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'],' - ',$title,'&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;base href=&quot;',BASE_URL,'&quot; /&amp;gt;
'.theme('css').'
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Just add this line just before the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tag,
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;30&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Like -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;title&amp;gt;',$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'],' - ',$title,'&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;&amp;lt;base href=&quot;',BASE_URL,'&quot; /&amp;gt;
'.theme('css').'
&amp;lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;refresh&quot; content=&quot;30&quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
And save it and upload it to your server. You can change the value 30 as u wish, it'll be counted as seconds and the page will refresh with that interval. :D
For reference,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;META tags with an HTTP-EQUIV attribute are equivalent to HTTP headers. Typically, they control the action of browsers, and may be used to refine the information provided by the actual headers.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
So, I'm just modifying the sent header data and saying the browser that, refresh the page with a 30 seconds interval. :D

But be careful. Don't give the value too less, or you might run out of API calls. :)

   <title>MySQL Database of 1000 Indian City Names</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/164/mysql-database-of-1000-indian-city-names/"/>
   <updated>2010-10-03T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/164/mysql-database-of-1000-indian-city-names</id>
   <content type="html">For an upcoming project of mine, I needed a wide list of indian cities with their states. I found that no readymade list is available. So, had no choice and created one for myself.

This list consists of 1000 Indian cities with their names, co-ordinates and corresponding parent areas, mostly states.

I'm posting the MySQL Import script here, so you'll just need to copy it and import it directly.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://pastebin.com/Vi2GZX6S&quot;&gt;http://pastebin.com/Vi2GZX6S&lt;/a&gt;
I hope it was useful to you. :)

Want Linux Discs? All you need is an internet connection to make the request and/or a postal address. I'm assuming you have the both. :)

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Its a bit tricky. First go here..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The form is opened at the beginning of each month. If it says that the form is closed for this month, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/CountryList&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;find your nearest Fedora ambassador from here&lt;/a&gt; and mail them. They will surely attend you as soon as possible.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Download &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

   <title>Return Multiple Values from AJAX script with ease</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/98/return-multiple-values-from-ajax-script-with-ease/"/>
   <updated>2010-09-25T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/98/return-multiple-values-from-ajax-script-with-ease</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; for Expert users. Only the novice guys who are interested in these stuff, might have a look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;While working on an AJAX implemented script, we sometimes need to return a lot of data from the server side script. If you've worked with AJAX, you'll know that the script returns the value as &lt;em&gt;httpObject.responseText&lt;/em&gt;. And the value of &lt;em&gt;responseText&lt;/em&gt; is what you echo from your script. Now that makes our scope limited.

Assuming that We have a javascript file &lt;em&gt;testAjaxJs.js&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;testAjaxPhp.php&lt;/em&gt; ..

If you try to make a lot of echo inside the php script, all of them are gonna get appended one behind another and appear like, for an example, this - &lt;em&gt;BibhasChandraDebnath&lt;/em&gt;.

Now, you may have an idea of echoing a special character like &lt;strong&gt;'-'&lt;/strong&gt; or&lt;strong&gt; '_' &lt;/strong&gt;after each echo so that you can then split the whole text inside the JS file using the split function and form an array.

That might be an idea, but there is a better way. Why not just use JSON to return data as array? Well, PHP can pretty much deal with JSON and it is a native thing to Javascript. So, it becomes easier. :)

Do this, initialize an array inside the php script, and whenever you have a data ready to be returned, insert it into the array.

So at the end of the script, you'll have an array like this -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: php&quot;&gt;Array
(
    [first_name] =&amp;gt; Bibhas
    [middle_name] =&amp;gt; Chandra
    [last_name] =&amp;gt; Debnath
)&lt;/pre&gt;
Now,we're gonna encode this data as JSON object. For that,
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: php&quot;&gt;$json_name=json_encode($array_name);&lt;/pre&gt;
Now your array will look like -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: php&quot;&gt;{&quot;first_name&quot;:&quot;Bibhas&quot;,&quot;middle_name&quot;:&quot;Chandra&quot;,&quot;last_name&quot;:&quot;Debnath&quot;}&lt;/pre&gt;
As this is a string to PHP, you can easily echo it. Now lets go to the Javascript part to read this JSON string we just sent to it.

Initialize a variable to store the returned string in it -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: js&quot;&gt;var jsonText = httpObject.responseText&lt;/pre&gt;
Now we need to transform this JSONText to a JSON Object. For that, we can use the eval() function. Like-
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: js&quot;&gt;var jsonObject= eval('('+jsonText+')');&lt;/pre&gt;
or
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: js&quot;&gt;eval('jsonObject='+jsonText);&lt;/pre&gt;
both works the same in this case.
So now that we have a JSON Object, lets get those data.
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: js&quot;&gt;var firstName=jsonObject.first_name;
var middleName=jsonObject.middle_name;
var lastName=jsonObject.last_name;&lt;/pre&gt;
And that's it, you've got your data back. :)

   <title>URL Shortening at your finger tip. :)</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/58/url-shortening-at-your-finger-tip/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-27T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/58/url-shortening-at-your-finger-tip</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;img class=&quot;alignleft&quot; title=&quot;Yourls Logo&quot; src=&quot;http://i36.tinypic.com/2eanmnc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;201&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; /&gt;I dunno about you guys, but I was getting weary of all the url shorteners that has grown like weeds around us.. Hence thought of using something that I could customize and use as I like. Hence did a Google search and found Yourls.

The case is simple, this service gives your site a capability to shorten urls. All you need is a Domain. Let it be a Top-Level Domain or a free one.. Now *this* is what I call usability. :)

&lt;!--more--&gt;As you already know, I maintain a TLD. So I thought of a URL shortener like &lt;strong&gt;bibhas.in/l/&lt;/strong&gt; ..
So, I downloaded Yourls. According to its guide, installed it and just ran it. And Voila! It works flawlessly. :)

Now, coming to the main points, what are the advantages of Yourls over &lt;a title=&quot;Bit.ly Pro&quot; href=&quot;https://bitly.com/pro/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bit.ly Pro(another similar service)&lt;/a&gt;?
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Yours is totally customizable. Its open source. So you can modify it anyway you want. :)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;All the link data are saved in your own database. Whereas Bit.ly stores then in its own database.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Yourls has a cool API that's fairly simple to use.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Yourls provides two bookmarklets to share any link you want to share on the go. :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Yourls gives you a local API. Means all the functions resides on your server. You're given an unique signature which you can use instead of username and password while making an API request.

And you call goes like this -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:plain&quot;&gt;http://bibhas.in/l/yourls-api.php?signature=f271546ece&amp;amp;action=shorturl&amp;amp;url=http://bibhas.in&amp;amp;format=xml&lt;/pre&gt;
as simple as that. :)

More details on the API can be found here - &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourls.org/#API&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://yourls.org/#API&lt;/a&gt;

Here is a screenshot of the default Yourls Link Dashboard -

Now, If you're interested in using it, Download Yourls from here - &lt;a title=&quot;Download Yourls&quot; href=&quot;http://yourls.org/download&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://yourls.org/download&lt;/a&gt;

   <title>Get two Page hits for a single link. ;)</title>
   <link href="http://bibhas.in/blog/49/get-two-pagehits-for-a-single-link/"/>
   <updated>2010-08-22T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>http://bibhas.in/blog/49/get-two-pagehits-for-a-single-link</id>
   <content type="html">Well, this was an idea from &lt;a title=&quot;Kuntal&amp;#039;s Extreme Tech Arena&quot; href=&quot;http://www.kuntalgupta.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kuntal Gupta&lt;/a&gt;. He asked me to make a redirecting script, so that if you pass any url to that page, it'll redirect to that link surely, but will also give your site a hit.

Then i just thought, why not use JS to turn all the hyperlinks to such redirecting links. That way, whenever someone clicks a link on your site, you get an extra hit, irrespective of  if the link is outgoing or in your site. :D

&lt;!--more--&gt;This is how it works -

Make a php file, name it redirect.php and save it in your root so that the location is, say, http://&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;your_url&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;/redirect.php and then edit the file and paste this code -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:php&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?php
   $url=$_REQUEST['url'];
   header(&quot;location: $url&quot;);
?&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Save it.

Now add this Javascript snippet in your site's header, inside the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt; block -
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:js&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; language=&quot;javascript&quot;&amp;gt;
function reDirectMe() {
  var link = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;a&quot;);
    for (var i=0;i&amp;lt;link.length;i++)
        {
            link[i].href = &quot;http://&amp;lt;your_url&amp;gt;/redirect.php?url=&quot;+link[i].href;
        }
}
window.onload=reDirectMe;
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Now obviously you'd like to change the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;your_url&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt; part to your domain.

And thats it. Now reload your site, and you'll see that all your hyperlinks have changed and now passes through the redirect.php file and gives you an extra hit every time you click a link.

Enjoy. :D
