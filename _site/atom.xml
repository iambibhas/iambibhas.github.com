   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a DuckDuckGo user for few users now. The idea of having no history of my searches, or rather not having to provide any identity to search the Internet, has always attracted me. Almost all the other search engines actively keep a track of who is searching what so that they can search better &amp;ldquo;personalized&amp;rdquo; results. Which also means that they know what you are looking for, at what time, from where etc.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Bangalore Auto fare vs Rest of the options</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I moved to Bangalore again last month. My new home is about 9km from my office. It&amp;rsquo;s not so bad because I don&amp;rsquo;t have to go to office everyday. Still, travelling in Bangalore has always been a bit pain for me, me being from Kolkata where everything is cheaper, specially transportation. You can travel 10km for Rs20 in the same auto that would cost you Rs130 in Bangalore, just because the concept of shared travelling is a big thing in Kolkata(which I wish were true in Bangalore). You have taxis in Kolkata which costs a bit less than Autos in Bangalore. Taxis in Kolkata costs about Rs12/km whereas autos in Bangalors costs about Rs13/km. And even buses are cheaper in Kolkata. Usually it&amp;rsquo;s Rs6 for first 4 km, and then increases by Rs2 for each 2-4 km. You can literally travel 12-14km for Rs10 in some routes. AC buses costs a bit more, but rarely more than Rs50 unless you&amp;rsquo;re travelling the whole route.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I was standing at a road crossing waiting for the signal to turn green to cross the road. There was a &amp;ldquo;No U Turn&amp;rdquo; sign at the crossing and couple of traffic police. Then a taxi comes and wants to take a right turn, from the look of it because the passanger couple wanted him to. The traffic police stops them of course. Then the male passanger, who was dressed really well with formal shirts (If you met him any random day he&amp;rsquo;d introduce himself as a gentleman I&amp;rsquo;m sure), starts arguing with the traffic police. His point being he&amp;rsquo;s taken right on that crossing before so he can take right again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Holi as a festival kind of sucks for me. I guess that&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of having fun while bathing in artifical colors.  So, I have to stay home for at least 3 days when everybody is &amp;ldquo;spreading the joy&amp;rdquo; outside. And if I go outside, they will share their &amp;ldquo;joy&amp;rdquo; with me too regardless of if I want to be a part of it or not. And they are not very considerate either. We Indians are &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; strict about that.&lt;/p&gt;

Exactly like Django has &lt;code&gt;./manage.py shell&lt;/code&gt;. But as we all know Tornado lacks a good documentation. Most of the things except the use of the native classes, require a lot of trial and error(at least for me, I&amp;rsquo;m not so bright). So I looked around and found how &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/23/&quot;&gt;has a way&lt;/a&gt; of having an interactive shell access to the environment.

   <title>Where Do I See Myself in 10 Years?</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/874/10-years-from-now/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-23T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/874/10-years-from-now</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Incident 1 (I'm in college, 1st year):&lt;/h3&gt;
The head of the dept. walks into our class, and throws us a question, &quot;Where do you see yourself in 10 years?&quot;. Honestly, I took that question a bit seriously, and that was the first time I realized that I didn't know what I should be in future. I didn't start as a developer then. Didn't even know I'm going to be what I am today. I was asked &quot;What is your aim in life?&quot; several times in my college days, I remember clearly that I answered differently every single time.
&lt;h3&gt;Incident 2 (1 year after I've started freelancing, 4th year of college):&lt;/h3&gt;
Few of my co-workers were already in their 3rd-4th startup, and were talking about what they want to do next(start up again if that one fails) and I was thrown the question, &quot;Bibhas, what are you going to do after college, and after couple of years?&quot;. I couldn't answer. I knew I will be working somewhere, developing something, but didn't know on what role, doing what.
&lt;h3&gt;Incident 3 (I left the first job because I didn't like it):&lt;/h3&gt;
And I'm thinking what to do next. Then it strikes me, I still didn't know what I want to be in life. I have ideas about how to build softwares, I want to keep doing it. But I also have a feeling that writing code takes a lot of time. It'd be nice if I had few colleagues writing codes. I was pretty sure this is going to be a deciding factor later in my life. But I still don't see the sign.
&lt;h3&gt;Incident 4 (a week back):&lt;/h3&gt;
I was talking to a colleague. He's seen his share of startup lives. We were talking about few of my friends who don't want to take risks working in startups and keep working at MNCs because those jobs are &quot;safe&quot;. Then he says, &quot;They should realize, are they living a life which they can tell their kids about?&quot;. I laughed in my head, thinking of a friend of mine telling his kid, &quot;You know? I used to work at an MNC. I used to go to office every freaging day at 9am and return at 10pm. I had a wonderful life.&quot; Don't know about you, but that seemed effin hilarious to me. But then I thought they might not realize it and think that they are too young to start &quot;taking risks&quot;.
&lt;h3&gt;Incident 5 (Present day):&lt;/h3&gt;
I come across this question in Quora: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Life/What-do-you-regret-not-doing-in-your-20s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you regret not doing in your 20s?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

It has few answers from people of 30s, sharing their views. I'd like to quote some of them here.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The only thing I regret in my 20's is not taking more risks. I took a ton of risks in my 20's from what I studied in school to where I lived to who I wanted to be. In the end, I could have been more fearless and more courageous to be exactly who I wanted to be, no matter what.

    The only advice I can offer: Do not listen to anyone else when you make big life decisions. No one knows you like you. When you make a big decision, do not listen to your parents, your siblings, your friends, or anyone else. It sounds absurd, but when I look back on my 20's the best decisions I made were ones I made myself that were protested by everyone around me.

    When you can stand truly on your own to make the correct choice while everyone around you is telling you that you're wrong, you're doing it right.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;...&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;It's not regret. But looking back, it seems my life would have been better if I had done / had known these earlier:
        &lt;ul&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On love:&lt;/strong&gt; Leave an unhappy relationship. It's not about commitment. It's about how to respect yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On work:&lt;/strong&gt; Quit an unhappy job. The feeling of being caged, deprived of the opportunity to learn new things simply because of your role - are not compensated by pay or even gratification of supporting your loved ones.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On emotion:&lt;/strong&gt; Appreciate, listen to, even indulge in emotions sometimes. It keeps a &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;human&lt;/span&gt; life. No worries, we're rational enough. Our brain is amazing.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On body:&lt;/strong&gt; Have happy (safe) sex more and earlier. Play fun sports more and earlier. Feeling a cramp in my leg once saved me from depression due to overthinking.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On money:&lt;/strong&gt; More is not better. There's a threshold over which you feel secured and free to pursue your dreams. Work constantly to lower this threshold. It frees you from constraints that you set for yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On desire/passion:&lt;/strong&gt; It's OK that desire/passion changes over time. Someday the dots can be linked. Before that, follow the passion even as it takes leaps and seems without focus.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On fear:&lt;/strong&gt; Never act/decide out of fear. You're doomed. Lying is an example.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On people:&lt;/strong&gt; Stay around those you want to become. If your network is not given, create it yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
           &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On human life:&lt;/strong&gt; You can change your life. Be kind, be honest (to others and to yourself), be grateful. Genuine happiness triumphs.&lt;/li&gt;
       &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;/blockquote&gt;
   ...
   &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not taking more risks.&lt;/strong&gt;

    Your 20s aren't like your 30s. You can afford to take more chances, try more things, take more risks to find out who you are and where you want to be.

    &lt;strong&gt;Not taking more action.&lt;/strong&gt;

    I thought that navel-gazing would lead me to answers to the existential angst which bugged me during my 20s. &lt;em&gt;Wrong&lt;/em&gt;. Acting and trying new things is the way to answers.

    &lt;strong&gt;Not sleeping around more.&lt;/strong&gt;

    In your 30s, you and the people you meet are looking for long-term commitment. If I were 20 again I'd stop looking for 'the one true love' (what can I say, I was a romantic) and look for more people to connect with, heart as well as body. Pining around for someone who didn't love me back on a off-on thing was a long waste of a few years.

    &lt;strong&gt;Not taking care of my body more.&lt;/strong&gt;

    In your 20s, you're in that weird transition where your body is somewhat but not quite as fit as your teen years and going into the less-hardy 30s. The start of my beer belly wasn't dramatic, and I figured it would go away like it always had in my teens. &lt;em&gt;Wrong.&lt;/em&gt; Once you see yourself going in your 20s, workout like hell to get yourself back in health and shape.
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    ...
    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    Well, if not entirely similar, I know I'm going to have some views that are common with these above. And I still don't know &lt;em&gt;what I'll be&lt;/em&gt; after 10 years.

    Right now I've bet everything I have on my instincts. I've moved to a new city. I've set up a decent place to stay even before getting the first salary. My bank balance is near zero. And my parents have already started pushing me about the deadline of my marriage!! BIG Sigh.

    On the bright side, I have this lovely girl beside me who thinks the world of me. I have my parents beside me who, even when we're running low on savings, are supporting me to do what I feel is right. I have an awesome colleague whom I've started to think as my mentor. I have few awesome friends who support me even when I'm down to the ground. I've already been part of 2 startups where things didn't quite work out as they planned. Yet I've joined another one.

    And I just realized, I really don't care anymore about what I want to be 10 years later. I'm just going to do what, I feel, is right and see where it goes. I have enough skills to earn my bread everyday. That's more than enough for me to go on.

   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/836/why-you-should-be-bothered-about-twitters-t-co-url-shortener-and-a-way-to-bypass-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;The way to bypass the t.co url is only for Twitter Web users. If you're not using it, If you're using an app, it wont help you.&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Since the very moment twitter introduced the automatic link shortening of all the links posted with it&amp;rsquo;s own t.co shortener, it bothered me. Why? Let me explain.&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twitter is using this t.co shortener just to track all the links being shared across it&amp;rsquo;s site. It can track how many links are being shared and how many of them are clicked. (Technically hat also enables them to know which resources are being more popular among the users. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how they are using that data.) But the real trouble is, t.co is just another server on your way to the original url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you notice carefully, most of the links you share or click nowadays are already shortened. And thanks to services like bit.ly, everyone can make a new link shortener in no time. While these shortened urls do look nice, they just push one node away from your destination node. When you click a shortened url, you are taken to the server where the link shortener is hosted and then redirected to the original destination. So, if it were to take you 100ms to reach your url, it&amp;rsquo;ll take you some more time than that if you click the shortener url.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;t.co is adding another node above what you already have. So that&amp;rsquo;s two node you have to be redirected from. For example, take this tweet -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where Have The Users Gone? &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/acgTzWKR&quot; title=&quot;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&quot;&gt;tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&lt;/a&gt; by @&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nireyal&quot;&gt;nireyal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TechCrunch/status/239765316601802752&quot;&gt;August 26, 2012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;TechCrunch already uses their own url shortener tcrn.ch, as you see. And when they share it on Twitter, it&amp;rsquo;s being shortened with the t.co url shortener. When you read the tweet, you can see the tcrn.ch url, but if you click it, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it&amp;rsquo;ll take you to a t.co link. That means, it&amp;rsquo;s an anchor, when the original url is the text and the t.co link is the url. That&amp;rsquo;s an effin bummer. :|&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this is how you have to visit your document now -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/acgTzWKR&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://t.co/acgTzWKR&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&lt;/a&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/26/where-have-the-users-gone/&quot;&gt;http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/26/where-have-the-users-gone/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I have to go through two server before I can get to my link. That&amp;rsquo;s really a pain in the arse for me, and should be for you too. Because if anyday the t.co server is slow because of the constant load it serves, &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I effin hate that. So wanted to get my way around it. I inspected the anchor tag of Twitter Web, this is what I got -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:js&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/acgTzWKR&quot; class=&quot;twitter-timeline-link&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; data-expanded-url=&quot;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&quot; title=&quot;http://tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot; wotsearchprocessed=&quot;true&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class=&quot;invisible&quot;&amp;gt;http://&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class=&quot;js-display-url&quot;&amp;gt;tcrn.ch/NTr6S8&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class=&quot;invisible&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;span class=&quot;tco-ellipsis&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;span class=&quot;invisible&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now if you see closely, twitter stores the original url as the value of &lt;span class=&quot;lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;data-expanded-url&lt;/span&gt; in the anchor tag. That is good for me. I just pushed a simple Javascript code that replaces the value of href property with the value of &lt;span class=&quot;lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;data-expanded-url&lt;/span&gt;&amp;rsquo;s value. And my work is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the javascript code -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:js&quot;&gt;si = window.setInterval(clearanchors, 2000);
function clearanchors(){
    anchors = document.getElementsByTagName('a')
    for(i=0;i&amp;lt;anchors.length;i++){
        if(anchors[i].getAttribute('data-expanded-url') != null){
        anchors[i].setAttribute('href', anchors[i].getAttribute('data-expanded-url'));
        }
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Just use any javascript pusher and push this to twitter.com. I personally use &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plcnnpdmhobdfbponjpedobekiogmbco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Personalized Web&lt;/a&gt;. so I created this recipe for it -&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screenshot-08262012-104737-PM.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter  wp-image-837&quot; title=&quot;Screenshot - 08262012 - 10:47:37 PM&quot; src=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Screenshot-08262012-104737-PM-300x184.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;184&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;I added it as timed function because or else it wont change the urls Twitter Web loads with ajax.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;These are the guiding principles of Python, but are open to interpretation. A sense of humor is required for their proper interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Rooting Xperia Neo V MT11i with 4.0.2.A.0.62 Build (on Ubuntu)</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/788/rooting-xperia-neo-v-mt11i-with-4-0-2-a-0-62-build-on-ubuntu/"/>
   <updated>2012-07-02T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/788/rooting-xperia-neo-v-mt11i-with-4-0-2-a-0-62-build-on-ubuntu</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: While rooting, unlocking bootloader would wipe all your phone's data and apps. So Backup before proceeding!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;Getting straight to the point, here is a step by step guide to rooting an Xperia Neo V MT11i on Ubuntu 11.10.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Small note: If you're running Windows, ignore step 1 and 3 and have the phone's USB drivers installed properly.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install &lt;span class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;libusb-dev&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline&quot;&gt;libusb-1.0-0-dev&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Get &lt;a href=&quot;http://androxyde.github.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flashtool&lt;/a&gt;. Download both 0.8.0.0 and 0.8.6.0 update. Extract both, then copy-paste the files from 0.8.6.0 folder to 0.8.0.0 folder. So that you have the updated version.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From terminal, go to the FlashTool directory, and run it -
&lt;pre class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true&quot;&gt;$ ./FlashTool&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Once FlashTool runs, turn on USB Debugging from the Settings&amp;gt;Applications&amp;gt;Development and Unknown Sources from the Settings&amp;gt;Applications.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Connect your phone to USB, &lt;strong&gt;Not in Mass Storage Device mode&lt;/strong&gt;. If it's connected successfully, you'll see some logs on the window of Flashtool. If there is any error, ask me.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Now you have to check if your phone's Boot loader is unlocked. To root, the boot loader needs to be unlocked. To check, Dial *#*#7378423#*#* . Then go to -&amp;gt; &quot;Service Info&quot; -&amp;gt; &quot;Configuration&quot;. If there is:
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bootloader unlock allowed - Yes &amp;lt;&amp;lt; this means that your Bootloader is Locked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bootloader Unlocked - Yes &amp;lt;&amp;lt; this means that your bootloader is unlocked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If BL is locked, from Flashtool, go to Plugins &amp;gt; Bootloader Unlock &amp;gt; Run and follow the instructions. At one point, it'll send you to Sony website for the unlock code where you have to approve the fact that your warranty is being void. :P&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Once the BL is unlocked, your phone would boot and you'll have lost all your apps, data, everything. You may then start from scratch again or restore from any previous backup.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Follow &lt;a href=&quot;http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=25610423&amp;amp;postcount=1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the tutorial at XDA&lt;/a&gt;. Ignore step 2 of that guide if you are using Ubuntu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
You'll have your phone rooted in no time. :)

   <title>PyCon India 2012 Registration is Open!</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/pycon-india-2012-registration-is-open"/>
   <updated>2012-06-19T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/pycon-india-2012-registration-is-open</id>
   <content type="html">PyCon is here again! Last year had awesome fun at PyCon 2011 as a beginner python-tamer. This time I'm hoping to have even more fun because I'll be able to understand more of what they are saying. :P&lt;!--more--&gt;

Unlike last time, PyCon 2012 is going to be held in Bangalore, at Dharmaram Vidya Kshetram from September 28-30. More details can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://in.pycon.org/2012/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;on their website&lt;/a&gt;. And their &lt;a href=&quot;http://pyconindia2012.doattend.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;registration page is at DoAttend&lt;/a&gt;. The Early Bird tickets are Rs600 + Rs300. I just bought 'em. Go get them while they last.

&lt;iframe width=&quot;630&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; marginheight=&quot;0&quot; marginwidth=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://maps.google.co.in/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;cid=11253468343780601834&amp;amp;q=Dharmaram+Vidya+Kshetram+Library&amp;amp;gl=IN&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=12.932634,77.605018&amp;amp;spn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;amp;output=embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;small&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;color: #0000ff; text-align: left;&quot; href=&quot;https://maps.google.co.in/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;cid=11253468343780601834&amp;amp;q=Dharmaram+Vidya+Kshetram+Library&amp;amp;gl=IN&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;t=m&amp;amp;ll=12.932634,77.605018&amp;amp;spn=0.006295,0.006295&amp;amp;source=embed&quot;&gt;View Larger Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Venue being Bangalore is fine for me as I have a friend's home where I can stay. Last year had real trouble with the place to stay in Pune. Had to crash at some unknown friend(!)'s place, then book a hotel room etc etc. But not this time.

Hoping to have some real good time. Also hoping to meet few friends I've only spoken to via web. That should be fun. :)

&lt;em&gt;Update&lt;/em&gt;: I wrote &lt;a title=&quot;PyCon India 2012 – More Details&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/785/pycon-india-2012-more-details/&quot;&gt;another post&lt;/a&gt; with more details about PyCon India 2012.

   <title>Development and Deployment of Flask app on Nginx with uWSGI+Supervisor</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/767/development-and-deployment-of-flask-app-on-nginx-with-uwsgi-supervisor/"/>
   <updated>2012-06-14T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/767/development-and-deployment-of-flask-app-on-nginx-with-uwsgi-supervisor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug, Jinja 2 and good intentions. And before you ask: It's &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/license/&quot;&gt;BSD licensed&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I came across &lt;a title=&quot;Flask&quot; href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; when I was going through the apps from &lt;a title=&quot;Hasgeek - Github&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/hasgeek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hasgeek&lt;/a&gt;. All their sites are built on Flask. So I thought of giving it a try and I'm not disappointed.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Flask is awesome. Minimal, supports Jinja for template managing and all you have to do is work on your app logic. Very less work involved to manage the framework. Here are the quick steps to follow to develop with Flask and deploy the app on an Nginx server -
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Install Flask&quot; href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/installation/#installation&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Install Flask in a vertualenv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make a file named your_app_name.py and &lt;a title=&quot;Flask Quickstart&quot; href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/#quickstart&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;start building your app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Test the app locally and when you think you're ready to deploy prepare your server.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install gcc, python, python-dev, python-virtualenv on your server.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;Flask Deployment Options&quot; href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/deploying/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;many deployment options&lt;/a&gt;, I chose uWSGI. It seemed to have very little footsteps.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Setup the virtualenv and transfer your files to server.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Install uWSGI inside your virtualenv with pip.
&lt;pre class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true&quot;&gt;pip install uwsgi&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;uWSGI + Supervisor&quot; href=&quot;http://www.readncode.com/blog/Deploying-Flask-with-nginx-uWSGI-and-Supervisor/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Deploy using uWSGI and Supervisor&lt;/a&gt;. Just one thing, instead of using that Symlink method to deploy your site, you might prefer to use these &lt;a title=&quot;nginx_ensite&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/perusio/nginx_ensite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;nginx_ensite and nginx_dissite commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I made a special executable named &lt;span class=&quot;lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;nginx_renabsite&lt;/span&gt;that disables the provided site config, reloads the server, then enables new config and again reloads the server -
&lt;pre class=&quot;top-set:false bottom-set:false lang:sh decode:true &quot;&gt;nginx_dissite $1
/etc/init.d/nginx reload
nginx_ensite $1
/etc/init.d/nginx reload&lt;/pre&gt;
Place this file to &lt;span class=&quot;lang:sh decode:true  crayon-inline&quot;&gt;/usr/sbin/nginx_renabsite&lt;/span&gt;and you can run it like
&lt;pre class=&quot;lang:default decode:true&quot;&gt;$ nginx_renabsite site_config_filename&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Your app should be up and running by now.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Once you make any changes to your app, upload the files to server, then &lt;a title=&quot;Reload supervisord&quot; href=&quot;http://supervisord.readthedocs.org/en/latest/running.html#running-supervisorctl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reload Supervisor with supervisorctl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Things should be fine now. :)

P.S. - Here is &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/1225493&quot;&gt;a fabfile&lt;/a&gt; for this deployment. I haven't tried it out yet.

   <content type="html">Last night like everyone I downloaded Instagram for my Android phone with really high hopes. But it seems they built the app in such a hurry that they forgot to adapt to the ways an Android app works.

   <title>My Life, Nowadays.</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/726/my-life-nowadays/"/>
   <updated>2012-03-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/726/my-life-nowadays</id>
   <content type="html">Thing have changed a lot, since the time, almost a year back, when I wrote about &lt;a title=&quot;And They Called My Name&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/416/and-they-called-my-name/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;getting a new job&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title=&quot;How Do You Leave Your Home, Again?&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/blog/482/how-do-you-leave-your-home-again/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leaving the city&lt;/a&gt;. I was all excited about going to Nagpur and staying around &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/Ramblinggeek&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karthik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/AgentAkki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Akshay&lt;/a&gt; and others. But (there is Always a but) things didn't go as I planned them.&lt;!--more--&gt;

As it turned out, I needed to stay in Kolkata for some more time, or rather I *was* needed to stay here. The mental environment at home wasn't that good. Things were almost upside down. And with me gone, things might have gone pretty much in some bad way. So I decided to stay. Decided not to go to Nagpur(apologized a lot to the friends there for that). Instead started looking for a job here that could get me started and could help me pull my family out of all those troubles. With some helps from a friend, got a position into a well-known SME here.

Things were well. I started to learn Python as it was a long time due in my to-learn list and also, the job required it. And fell in love with Python. I wanted to take my time and learn it properly. But the job required me to be Fast, as, along with learning Python, I had to manage servers, databases, almost everything that was needed in a web service development team, all by myself. So I started learning it fast and I was enjoying it! Started doing overtime at home. Whole day at office, half the night at home. Barely few hours of sleep and no (time for) rest at all. And just when it shouldn't have, my health gave up.

I've always been of a little weak health. Spondilytis-like syndrome was already detected once when I was at high school. 3 years of treatment fixed me up, and stopped my outdoor sports habits. That's when I started to like computer. Few more months and I knew I couldn't live without it. Something similar happened this time too. After few weeks of above mentioned schedule, neck pain started. It got more severe by every day. Went to doctor, did an X-Ray of neck and he kind of predicted the worse. According to him, that old syndrome of mine was back and I was told to stop working sitting in front of computers for hours, for at least few months(that might expand to unknown period of time), and take rest, do exercises and etc etc.

I knew that was the end of my job. As I suddenly had to quit, right when I was most needed there(provided I was a one-man team), couldn't leave in good terms. But that needed to be done, for my own sake.

One month passed. I was maintaining all the regular exercise and stuff. I would hardly come online from PC, let alone work. But given it was me(I don't remember when was the last time I spent a day without using my PC or visit the cyber cafe when I didn't have one), I just couldn't suddenly *stop* working! Programming is everything to me. Can't spend a day without writing something, hacking something up.

So even with all those instructions from the doctor, I started being what I am. But still couldn't code or linger around for longer than few hours at a stretch.

Even though I was miserable, I couldn't ignore the problems at home. I needed to earn something. So I called up a friend. Told him I needed a work. And he also needed someone somewhat like me. No Python this time. But I got what I needed. Some work to earn me something. Enough time to rest, and learn Python(I really love it). Things have been going on like that since then.

Now things are looking good. Health is much better. Can spend less time on PC, when I'm not working, thanks to the new smartphone. Found new friends. Disconnected myself from all the previous contacts. I needed a new start. Needed to do things a new way. I figure, I was trying to get ahead of myself a year back. I remember all the foolish mistakes. Now I'm slowing down. Behaving like a 22 years old. Now all I'm looking for is an adventure. Planning to leave the city soon. Things at home are almost settled. Found friends who can accompany me in my adventure. Looking for places I can fit in. Everything is falling into places.

I'm really excited.

   <title>Education, how I wanted it to be.</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/education-how-i-wanted-it-to-be"/>
   <updated>2012-03-30T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/education-how-i-wanted-it-to-be</id>
   <content type="html">The other day I was chatting at &lt;a href=&quot;http://superuser.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SuperUser&lt;/a&gt; chatroom and &lt;em&gt;@studiohac&lt;/em&gt;k mentioned that he had a &lt;strong&gt;Intro-to-Mac&lt;/strong&gt; class that evening. That sounded funny as it was completely strange to me, having studied here in India. The closest subject I had to that was &quot;Introduction to Computing&quot; which was boring, and boiled down to C lessons, nothing more. I felt interested. And we started talking about how we taught ourselves.&lt;!--more--&gt;

Most of us in that chatroom at that point were self-taught. Including me. Whatever I know about computers, programming and all related things, I taught myself those. College taught me very few stuffs that I use now, but even for those we had in syllabus, I was aware of them beforehand.

Back to the topic, &lt;em&gt;@Sidran32&lt;/em&gt; started talking about how he learned things in his college -
&lt;blockquote&gt;You know, when I went to my college, they never intro'd us to Windows, Mac, or Linux/Solaris/UNIX. They just kind of threw us on Solaris machines, gave us a 1 day rudimentary overview on commands like &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;, and then just let us have at it.

When I took a class that had us work on Macs in the Mac lab, there was barely anything else, other than &quot;these are the programs we're going to use, and this is how you compile in XCode&quot;. :P

It was actually kind of fun. :P If we wanted to ssh from our dorms, we were on our own. Everyone eventually figured out how to, but the teachers only gave suggestions (like putty) if we asked them after class.

Heh, there was a cracked version of xwin32 going around campus for a while. I used that until I figured out how to use cygwin, and then started experimenting with dual-booting Linux. :P&lt;/blockquote&gt;
My immediate reaction was &quot;&lt;strong&gt;This&lt;/strong&gt; is how education should be!&quot;.

Nowadays I'm looking ahead for a masters degree. Not because it will add some more characters in my resume, just because I feel that I wasted those 4 years of mine. First year barely had any computer related subjects(Mind it that I was studying Information Technology). So, as a result, in that year, my rank was being counted from bottom. I failed a subject and was ranked second from last. :P

&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;rant&amp;gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We were taught how to crack exams. How to score more. So, plagiarism was considered legit. Teachers wont say so, but they hardly reacted if someone was found copying in exams. Assignments were meant for 4 to 5 students in the class. Others are supposed to copy from them. We used to stay awake the night before exam hoping that the paper would leak. We used to hide books in cloths and go to bathroom during exams to study. Apart from the fact that the syllabus is obsolete, no real life scenarios were discussed in the laboratories. Most of my batch-mates never heard of SSH(the case is still the same, although they are working in reputed Tech companies), let alone know how to use it. Version Controlling is alien to most. Software development life cycles meant waterfall model. Agile was Hebrew. Teachers would write the whole client-server communication program in C on white board so that students could copy it and vomit on the paper during exams. Handful of us knew how to debug a C code, how to trace the errors. We used to have strike in college(Shutting down college activities, classes, labs) if any of us failed in the exams. Students would lock the Principal and faculties in the college saying that students should not be failed. Those same students spent the semester at the corner of the college field smoking Gold Flake, instead of attending the class. Still it was the college's fault if they failed the exam. Hilarious. Ridiculous. &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;/rant&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

I regret those years. If it were possible, I'd have done the same graduation in some institute where they teach the way &lt;em&gt;@Sidran32&lt;/em&gt; was taught.

I read articles where big-shot corporate gurus rant that only 10-15% of the student mass in India are employable. I wish they had spent at least 5% of their fortune in teaching these students. Where students feel challenged every single moment of those 4 years. I guess it's too much to ask.

Pity.

   <title>My Website's New Homepage</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/my-websites-new-homepage"/>
   <updated>2012-03-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/my-websites-new-homepage</id>
   <content type="html">I always get stuck when I try to find a template for my website's homepage. I've tried lot of templates, designed some myself(which sucked a lot), even tried using services like About[dot]me. But none of them truly satisfied me.&lt;!--more--&gt;

One fact about myself is that I *Love* Terminal. I Love shell. So while thinking about a theme for my homesite, it suddenly occurred to me to put a shell on my site! It's pretty damn straight. Can easily be done with Javascript. And I can very easily evolve it!(this is the part I Love most) I can put innumerable things in it. So I built &lt;a title=&quot;Bibhas.in&quot; href=&quot;http://bibhas.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.

After building it, I suddenly thought of showing it off a bit and then &lt;a href=&quot;http://geekli.st/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Geekli.st&lt;/a&gt; came in my mind. I've signed up for a long time there but never created a card. So went ahead and created a card - &lt;a title=&quot;Geekli.st - I've put a Shell on my website.&quot; href=&quot;http://geekli.st/iAmBibhas/ive-put-a-shell-on-my-website&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I've put a Shell on my website&lt;/a&gt;. Got the first ^5 in few minutes and then within few hour it was trending! And &lt;a title=&quot;Geekli.st Trending Cards&quot; href=&quot;http://geekli.st/cards#trending&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;it is still(at the time of this post) trending&lt;/a&gt;! Got &lt;del&gt;5&lt;/del&gt; 6 ^5 till now. But that's enough. Enough to keep me working on it and something new. :)

1:03 AM right now. Was thinking of pulling a whole-nighter, but had a rough day and now this headache and stomach-ache is killing me. I guess I'll sleep for tonight. Just added two new stuff in the site - using the &quot;open&quot; option with &quot;blog&quot; or &quot;github&quot; command will open my blog and github profile in a new tab.

   <title>Making Skype usable on Fedora 14 and maybe later versions too</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/making-skype-usable-on-fedora-14-and-maybe-later-versions-too"/>
   <updated>2012-02-12T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/making-skype-usable-on-fedora-14-and-maybe-later-versions-too</id>
   <content type="html">I use Skype a lot. But although Skype has a fantastic version for Windows, the Linux part is a bit weak. I run Fedora 14 on my laptop(Compaq CQ42 173TU) and for some reason, Skype wont run on it. With the RPM package of 2.2 Beta, it gets installed but never runs. So I installed the static version of it following this instructions here. But when I would try to run skype from terminal, this error would occur -
[bash]
[root@localhost ~]# skype
skype: error while loading shared libraries: libXv.so.1:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[/bash]
So to check which dependency package I was missing, I searched with YUM -
[bash]
[root@localhost ~]# yum whatprovides libXv.so.1
[/bash]
and found that this specific package &lt;span class=&quot;lang:default decode:true  crayon-inline &quot;&gt;libXv-1.0.5-1.fc13.i686&lt;/span&gt; has that specific file. So although I'm running Fedora 14 and it's of x86_64 architecture, I installed that package which was meant for Fedora 13 and i686 architecture. Then ran skype from terminal and it worked!

   <title>Avail Request Object in Django Form Validation</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/avail-request-object-in-django-form-validation"/>
   <updated>2012-01-13T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/avail-request-object-in-django-form-validation</id>
   <content type="html">It may sometime happen that to validate a form field you need to check the value with some existing value from the database related to the User or some other entity. But sadly Django doesn't allow accessing the Request object in the clean() or clean_&amp;lt;FieldName&amp;gt;() methods. Here is a way around it - &lt;!--more--&gt;

All you need to do is override the default __init__() function of forms.Form with this -
[python]
def __init__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
    self.request = request
    super(CreateTagForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
[/python]
Now when you call the Form, you can call it like -
[python]
form = YourForm(request, request.POST)
[/python]
Now the whole code will look like -
[python]
from django import forms

class YourForm(forms.Form):
    name = forms.CharField(max_length=50, min_length=1)
    mark = forms.IntegerField(min_value=1, max_value=100)

    def __init__(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        self.request = request
        super(YourForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def clean_mark(self):
        marks_left = get_marks_left(self.request.user)
        # Do what more you want to do
[/python]

That's it. Happy Coding. :)

   <title>Setup Bridged Network inside VirtualBox on Debian/Ubuntu</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/setup-bridged-network-inside-virtualbox-on-debian-ubuntu"/>
   <updated>2012-01-11T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/setup-bridged-network-inside-virtualbox-on-debian-ubuntu</id>
   <content type="html">I cannot stay away from Terminal. :| So I was setting up a debian box inside my Windows installation. I downloaded a net installation image of Debian 6.0.3 (&lt;a title=&quot;Direct link to the image file&quot; href=&quot;http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/i386/iso-cd/debian-6.0.3-i386-netinst.iso&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;debian-6.0.3-i386-netinst.iso&lt;/a&gt;) and booted into it in VirtualBox. Well, while installing it, VB was in NAT mode and I didn't notice that. So the installer configured the OS according to NAT mode and I had the network connection after I logged in. But as I wanted to run few server applications, I needed the OS to use a bridged connection. So I opened the network configuration of VB, changed it to Bridged Adapter mode, selected by adapter, hit Ok, then restarted the network service in the box and tried to ping google. But got error. The network wasn't working.

&lt;!--more--&gt;

Fired up Google, but after few searches, I landed on the conclusion that it was the basic network configuration that I needed to follow. :|

i.e. Following commands -
[bash]
sudo  ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.5 netmask 255.255.255.0
sudo route add default gw 10.0.0.1  eth0
#Now restart networking
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[/bash]

That did the trick.

   <title>PHP Console Inside Your Browser</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/php-console-inside-your-browser"/>
   <updated>2011-12-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/php-console-inside-your-browser</id>
   <content type="html">I was looking for a tool where I can write a little snippet in PHP and test it out/debug really quickly. First thought of something like these online compilers, like IDEONE. But it's too heavy for my taste. I needed something faster. Yesterday, came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://seld.be/notes/php-console-in-your-browser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Jordi Boggiano, who saved some work of mine(and lot of other developers) and made a tool that can run inside your browser, and let you run and debug PHP codes with ease, and it's also FAST.&lt;!--more--&gt;Here is a screenshot -

[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;622&quot; caption=&quot;PHP Console&quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http://seld.be/_misc/php-console.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot; &quot; title=&quot;PHP Console&quot; src=&quot;http://seld.be/_misc/php-console.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;622&quot; height=&quot;505&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]

Looks good, right? You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/seldaek/php-console&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;grab the tool from github&lt;/a&gt; and use it on your localhost or your personal server, wherever you want. :)

   <title>Manage Your Cloud Server Easily Using Virtualmin</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/manage-your-cloud-server-easily-using-virtualmin"/>
   <updated>2011-11-06T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/manage-your-cloud-server-easily-using-virtualmin</id>
   <content type="html">A friend of mine owns an &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AWS&lt;/a&gt;(Amazon Web Services) account and wants to run an &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;EC2&lt;/a&gt;(Elastic Compute Cloud) instance for his domain. But the problem is, he is not much technically sound to handle the Ubuntu server himself. A solution like cPanel is much better for him because then he can just click and have stuffs done, without writing a single line of command. But sadly, cPanel aint free. So is there any free alternative? I searched a bit and found that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.webmin.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Webmin&lt;/a&gt; and its derivative &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualmin.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Virtualmin&lt;/a&gt; matches the criterion perfectly. &lt;!--more--&gt;

To make his job easy, I wrote a Python script using &lt;a href=&quot;http://fabfile.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fabric&lt;/a&gt;, that automatically logs into his EC2 instance and installs all the packages required(e.g. lamp-server) (Will post the Fabric recipe later). I just needed to install the Virtualmin on it for him to control everything smoothly.

Virtualmin is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualmin.com/documentation/installation/manual&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bit complicated&lt;/a&gt; to setup. So they provide an installation script to make the job easy. To install Virtualmin on any server, first &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualmin.com/download.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;choose the appropriate installation script from here&lt;/a&gt; for your server, then do this(I'm using the installation script for Ubuntu) -
[crayon lang=&quot;sh&quot;]
$ wget http://software.virtualmin.com/gpl/scripts/install.sh
$ sudo sh install.sh
[/crayon]

This should install Webmin, Virtualmin and configure everything.

Now, as we usually use a keypair file to SSH to cloud servers like EC2, there is no password for root user. But to login to the virtualmin interface, you'll need to set a password for the root user only for the virtualmin interface. It is NOT about setting a root password for your server's root user. This is just a password to login to virtualmin. To do that, execute this command -
[crayon lang=&quot;sh&quot;]
//For ubuntu
sudo /usr/share/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin root XYZ
//if not, then
sudo /usr/libexec/webmin/changepass.pl /etc/webmin root XYZ
//Where XYZ is the new password
[/crayon]

Once you've done this, go visit -
[crayon lang=&quot;html&quot;]
https://example.com:10000
[/crayon]
Or:
[crayon lang=&quot;html&quot;]
https://xxx.xx.xx.xxx:10000
[/crayon]

Remember, You MUST use https. And Virtualmin is available on port 10000 by default. So remember to edit your security group(in case of Amazon AWS) to allow TCP access to port 10000.

If you've done everything right, you'll be able to see the login page of Virtualmin. Dont bother if your browser shows some warning about the validity of the SSL security when you use https, Just ignore it and proceed.

Once you login, you'll see a panel like this -

[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;448&quot; caption=&quot;Virtualmin Admin Panel&quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/IBiuF.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;    &quot; title=&quot;Virtualmin Admin Panel&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/IBiuF.png&quot; alt=&quot;Virtualmin Admin Panel&quot; width=&quot;448&quot; height=&quot;214&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]

Now you can add Virtual Servers and configure them as much as you can. You can add virtual hosts to add domain names, setup Email servers etc etc and a lot more things.

Go ahead and give it a try. If you face any trouble, ask me or consult &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.virtualmin.com/documentation/installation/automated&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Virtualmin's official installation guide&lt;/a&gt;.

Happy Cloud Computing. :)

   <title>WeekEndHack: The New Thing in Town!</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/weekendhack-the-new-thing-in-town"/>
   <updated>2011-08-28T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/weekendhack-the-new-thing-in-town</id>
   <content type="html">Ever since I came from Yahoo! Open Hack India, I've been craving for more nights like the one I had in Bangalore. Couldn't just shake that excitement off. It was too much to ignore. So I have been looking for a way to do that again.

To those who are new to this idea of Hack-nights, No this is _Not_ the usual meaning of the word &quot;Hack&quot; you come across. To us, &quot;Hack&quot; means - to build something in a very short time with whatever tools you have with you, breaking them apart and fixing them in an unique way to solve a certain purpose.

As a developer, no wonder I found it pretty interesting and was looking for a way to bring it to the town, our Kolkata, where a tech event is as rare as a Pink moon. :-/&lt;!--more--&gt;

The way was just in front of me, but I have been ignoring it for sometime. I have friends here who love programming, like me. They love developing small apps for their own use. They also share them to the world. So I started contacting them asking if they are interested in doing something like a hack-night. They seemed pretty interested, so I decided we're not going to waste times planning. So 5 of us(Me, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sonthalia.umang&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Umang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/rabimba&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rabimba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/golchha21&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ulhas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/mehulpangtey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mehul&lt;/a&gt;) just gathered up last Saturday and conduced the First ever WeekEndHack in Kolkata! I named it so because it seemed most appropriate. Also it's short enough to be a Twitter hashtag. :P

Here is a trivia of it, if last Saturday was the v1.0 of WeekEndhack, we had a beta release of it. The weekend before the last one, Me and Umang spent a night at a CCD in Sector 5 to get the idea of how it feels and how it should be. We felt that CCD is a bit out of budget for us, so the v1.0 final release was arranged a flat in South Kolkata, that belonged to a relative of Ulhas and was empty at that day. Turned out that it was perfectly OK. :)

So, as it was the first night, we spent the first half doing absolutely nothing new. We just put up a facebook page and a website for ourselves. You can visit them &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/WeekEndHack&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weekendhack.in/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; respectively. Then as the night started fading, ideas seemed to pour onto us. We were coming up with one idea after another. Each of them were more interesting than the previous one. We mostly depended on Umang to decide the feasibility of the idea as he has a good knowledge about the current web market and apps. And when the sun was almost out, we found the gem we've gathered for. For some obvious reasons I'm unable to disclose the details right now, but you'll see some fruit out of it pretty soon. :)

As we were almost out of time, we couldn't finish building a prototype for it, so we saved it for the next WeekEndHack, which we're planning to hold on 3rd September.  Till then, we're working on the website, and the facebook page and trying to connect to as many passionate minds as possible. We've got about 5-6 requests till now. I'm guessing the next one will be larger than the first one. :)

And to add more to it, I'm trying to get some sponsor for it. Almost decided on one. A startup has agreed to give us some space to work at. :) I'll publish more details on the website itself. So keep an eye on the website. The address is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.weekendhack.in/&quot;&gt;WeekEndHack.in&lt;/a&gt; .

I'm looking forward to my friends in other cities to start the same thing at their home town itself. Chennai and Bangalore already has such events. But we are asking people from cities like Kolkata to start this, where tech events rarely happens. And I planned on doing this every alternate Saturday because I want people to get used to the idea. The main motto is to bring out the hidden passionate people out of the crowd, those who either don't know any way to reach out to people about their ideas or thinks that doing so is impossible here in Kolkata.

So we'll keep this up. If you've found the idea interesting, do contact me and Join us. We're looking for your participation that can make the image of the city better in front of the world. :)

   <title>First Ever Apple Logo</title>

   <updated>2011-08-18T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/first-ever-apple-logo</id>
   <content type="html">I never knew that Apple didn't always have the &quot;apple&quot; as the logo. This is their first logo -

&lt;!--more--&gt;

[caption id=&quot;&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;468&quot; caption=&quot;Apple Inc. - First Logo&quot;]&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/S8l2x.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;   &quot; style=&quot;border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid;&quot; title=&quot;Apple First Logo&quot; src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/S8l2x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Apple First Logo&quot; width=&quot;468&quot; height=&quot;585&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]

Click on it for a Higher resolution[1958 x 2457] version.

This logo was designed by Ron Wayne, the designer of Apple Inc at that time. The logo features Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was inspired by a quotation by Wordsworth that was also inscribed into the logo that said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Newton… A Mind Forever Voyaging Through Strange Seas of Thought... Alone.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/only-domain-name-is-not-enough</id>
   <content type="html">There was a time when a domain name was enough for any business or product for their web presence. We were happy with &lt;a title=&quot;McAfee&quot; href=&quot;http://www.McAfee.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.McAfee.com&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a title=&quot;Amazon&quot; href=&quot;http://www.Amazon.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; .. But the scenario is different now. It seems we can't be satisfied with just the domain name now. We also want &lt;a title=&quot;McAfee Twitter&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/McAfee&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;@McAfee&lt;/a&gt; or @&lt;a title=&quot;Amazon on Twitter&quot; href=&quot;http://twitter.com/Amazon&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Or rather those brands need them even more than a website now.

   <content type="html">My final year project requires both the use of .NET and PHP/MySQL.

Seemed cool. went ahead and downloaded the latest stable version 6.3.6 of the .NET connector. But when I tried to install it, the installation failed unexpectedly. There were no error log for me to analyze and take step. Only this error message from the installer -

   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/a-day-with-kws-kolkata-weekend-shoots</id>
   <content type="html">I've been added to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=27363419159&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;KWS Facebook group&lt;/a&gt; for sometime. And being an amateur(read nOOb) photographer, I always wanted to meet others who are just like me or more expert and learn from them. Hence a photowalk was always welcome to me. So when I learned that KWS is going to hold a photowalk at West Bengal State Handicraft Expo 2011 at Milan Mela ground, I really wanted to join and started poking &lt;a class=&quot;aptureEnhance&quot; href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/cybercool10/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kuntal&lt;/a&gt; for his secondary camera(&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/cameras/nikon/coolpix_p90/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nikon Coolpix P90&lt;/a&gt;) for a day as I don't have a camera myself. Well, luckily Kuntal managed it somehow and on that day, we went to the venue together.

   <title>Install Adobe Flash Player 10.2 on Fedora 14 x86_64</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/install-adobe-flash-player-10-2-on-fedora-14-x86-64"/>
   <updated>2011-02-25T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/install-adobe-flash-player-10-2-on-fedora-14-x86-64</id>
   <content type="html">Reading the title may make you feel it's pretty simple - Download the flash player rpm package from adobe.com, install it and Done. I thought so too. But even if flash-plugin was installed, Firefox wasn't detecting it. So did some old-style googling, and came up with these commands.
&lt;!--more--&gt;
Remember, my one is Fedora 14 x86_64, it might not work for other versions.
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1. Open Terminal and go to Root user mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;
su -
Enter password: &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2. Install Adobe YUM Repository RPM package&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;rpm -ivh http://linuxdownload.adobe.com/adobe-release/adobe-release-i386-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-adobe-linux
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3. Update Repositories(Optional, Do if you haven't done it recently)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;yum check-update&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4. Install required packages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;pre class=&quot;brush:bash&quot;&gt;yum install flash-plugin nspluginwrapper.x86_64 nspluginwrapper.i686 alsa-plugins-pulseaudio.i686 libcurl.i686&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This command should also work on &lt;strong&gt;Fedora 13, Fedora 12 and Red Hat (RHEL) 6 64-bit version (x86_64) (32 bit wrapped version)&lt;/strong&gt;..&lt;/blockquote&gt;
That's it. Restart Firefox and you should be able to run Flash stuff. Head for Youtube to test it.

   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/a-fedora-day-at-gcect-kolkata</id>
   <content type="html">Kolkata is usually not very frequent when it comes to organizing Tech related events. mostly because that crowd is very small every time someone tries something. But despite that, I've been trying to attend as many events possible and bring then together, so that everytime we can have atleast some new faces. That is actually how the crowd grows.

   <title>Build your own IRC bot in PHP</title>
   <link href="https://bibhas.in/blog/209/build-your-own-irc-bot-in-php/"/>
   <updated>2010-11-17T00:00:00+05:30</updated>
   <id>https://bibhas.in/blog/209/build-your-own-irc-bot-in-php</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I started using IRC about 2 months ago. I know its lame of me to get to that stuff so late. But from the very point I logged into a channel, the thing that caught most of my attention was a Bot that used to respond to user command. Now that seemed interesting. I dug some codes in Github, did some Googling and got the idea. Then found a sample snippet of how to create an IRC bot with PHP, at www.thegeeks.us which wasn&amp;rsquo;t much functional to start with.. I started testing the code and thanks to Ben(spookz), one of the member(and most probably a co-founder too) of thegeeks.us, with some &lt;em&gt;inspiration&lt;/em&gt; from him, I got this thing to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I built quite a few commands for myself. But I&amp;rsquo;d rather not post them in a blog which is pretty much in Google&amp;rsquo;s reach. :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am posting the code here so that you can customize it and build your own bot with it. The code itself is documented with comments. Still, if you have any type of doubt, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;/*
* PHP IRC Bot
* Customized by Bibhas.

//Sends USER HOSTNAME IDENT :REAL NAME Change it as you wish.
fputs($socket,&quot;USER PHPBot bibhas.in PHP :The PHP Bot\n&quot;);

//Sends the NICK to server. Choose a unique one or the script will fail.
fputs($socket,&quot;NICK php-bot-custom\n&quot;);

//Enter the channel you want to use your bot on.
fputs($socket,&quot;JOIN #sample-channel\n&quot;);

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To run the bot:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can run it from either command prompt with php and  Apache server installed or you can run it from a browser. For the later case, just execute the script file form the browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There you go. Leave comment if you have doubt. Or directly reach me at twitter or facebook. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:Note to myself:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code looks like a mess. Clean it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;This post is imported from an old blog of mine. But I've updated it. You can check it as a new post. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Want Linux Discs? All you need is an internet connection to make the request and/or a postal address. I'm assuming you have the both. :)
&lt;!--more--&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;border: 1px solid black;&quot; src=&quot;http://i56.tinypic.com/wilp9v.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; height=&quot;118&quot; border=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Request CD &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

You need to download it now.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Download &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Download &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Its a bit tricky. First go here..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;The form is opened at the beginning of each month. If it says that the form is closed for this month, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/CountryList&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;find your nearest Fedora ambassador from here&lt;/a&gt; and mail them. They will surely attend you as soon as possible.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Download &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Request CD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Most of the distros are not available in postal delivery as it needs much maintenance.. But you can download them always..

   <title>Return Multiple Values from AJAX script with ease</title>

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; for Expert users. Only the novice guys who are interested in these stuff, might have a look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;While working on an AJAX implemented script, we sometimes need to return a lot of data from the server side script. If you've worked with AJAX, you'll know that the script returns the value as &lt;em&gt;httpObject.responseText&lt;/em&gt;. And the value of &lt;em&gt;responseText&lt;/em&gt; is what you echo from your script. Now that makes our scope limited.
