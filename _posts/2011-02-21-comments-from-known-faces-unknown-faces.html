title: Comments from Known faces, Unknown faces
---
If you've read my blog before, you'll know that I keep attending all the tech/web related events here. Thankfully, I've been able to collaborate with many active faces here and also brought together few more in that list. Yesterday (20th Feb '11) was a day full of fun and cheers coming from each and everyone.. Two Major bloggers' meet on a single day. Heck, whattay day it was!

At the indiBlogger meet, there was a social networking session, where everyone has been given a white paper which they can hang on their back and go to other people, talk to them, introduce self and ask for a comment.. It was a really interesting session. Loved it. My piece of paper was full of comments written by people I hardly know, and also some people I'm lucky to know.. I'm gonna share the comments here, because I want to remember them. For an eternity..<!--more-->

This is the exact reason I love networking.. People are like pieces of puzzles. You can build a great picture when you bring them together.. So, keep networking.. :)
