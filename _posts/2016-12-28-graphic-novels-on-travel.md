I love graphic novels. They are a visual treat, the best way to tell stories. And I also like to travel and reading about travel stories. I've come across some graphic novels on travel that tells you about real places and real people. So thought of mentioning them here. I've read some of them, and plan to read the others soon.

## [Shenzhen: A Travelogue from China](http://amzn.to/2iq7f2K)

Author: [Guy Delisle](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/46027.Guy_Delisle)

![Shenzhen: A Travelogue from China](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1330445378l/210946.jpg)

Guy Delisle's work for a French animation studio requires him to oversee production at various Asian studios on the grim frontiers of free trade. His employer puts him up for months at a time in 'cold and soulless' hotel rooms where he suffers the usual deprivations of a man very far from home. After _Pyongyang_, his book about the strange society that is North Korea, Delisle turned his attention to Shenzhen, the cold, urban city in Southern China that is sealed off with electric fences and armed guards from the rest of the country. The result is another brilliant graphic novel - funny, scary, utterly original and illuminating.

## [Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City](http://amzn.to/2hx7YCn)

![Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347396940l/13104040.jpg)

Guy Delisle expertly lays the groundwork for a cultural road map of contemporary Jerusalem, utilizing the classic stranger in a strange land point of view that made his other books, _Pyongyang_, _Shenzhen_, and _Burma Chronicles_ required reading for understanding what daily life is like in cities few are able to travel to. In _Jerusalem: Chronicles from the Holy City_, Delisle explores the complexities of a city that represents so much to so many. He eloquently examines the impact of the conflict on the lives of people on both sides of the wall while drolly recounting the quotidian: checkpoints, traffic jams, and holidays.

When observing the Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations that call Jerusalem home, Delisle's drawn line is both sensitive and fair, assuming nothing and drawing everything. Jerusalem showcases once more Delisle's mastery of the travelogue.

Famously referred to as one of the "Axis of Evil" countries, North Korea remains one of the most secretive and mysterious nations in the world today. In early 2001 cartoonist Guy Delisle became one of the few Westerners to be allowed access to the fortress-like country. While living in the nation's capital for two months on a work visa for a French film animation company, Delisle observed what he was allowed to see of the culture and lives of the few North Koreans he encountered; his findings form the basis of this graphic novel.

## [How to Understand Israel in 60 Days or Less](http://amzn.to/2igMnLv)

Author: [Sarah Glidden](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2817217.Sarah_Glidden)

![How to Understand Israel in 60 Days or Less](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1309398564l/7941986.jpg)

A stunningly accomplished debut graphic novel, HOW TO UNDERSTAND ISRAEL IN 60 DAYS OR LESS is Sarah Glidden's charming and funny travel memoir of her trip through Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, Masada and other historic locales, brought to life with lush watercolors in all of their quirky and breathtaking detail.

At the same time, ISRAEL is a sensitive, deeply thoughtful and personal examination of a highly charged issue, an account of a journey Sarah never expected to take. Her experience clashes with her preconceived notions again and again, particularly when she tries to take a non-chaperoned excursion into the West Bank. As she struggles to "understand Israel," Sarah is forced to question first her beliefs, then ultimately her own identity.

## [Palestine](http://amzn.to/2hQ20Zf)

Author: [Joe Sacco](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32468.Joe_Sacco)

In late l991 and early 1992, at the time of the first Intifada, Joe Sacco spent two months with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, travelling and taking notes. Upon returning to the United States he started writing and drawing Palestine, which combines the techniques of eyewitness reportage with the medium of comic-book storytelling to explore this complex, emotionally weighty situation. He captures the heart of the Palestinian experience in image after unforgettable image, with great insight and remarkable humour.

## [Tokyo on Foot: Travels in the City's Most Colorful Neighborhoods](http://amzn.to/2iiQkzp)

Author: [Florent Chavouet](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2888780.Florent_Chavouet)

![Tokyo on Foot: Travels in the City's Most Colorful Neighborhoods](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388988112l/9722408.jpg)

Florent Chavouet, a young graphic artist, spent six months exploring Tokyo while his girlfriend interned at a company there. Each day he would set forth, with a pouch full of colored pencils and a sketchpad, to visit different neighborhoods. This stunning book records the city that he got to know during his adventures, a gritty, vibrant place, full of ordinary people going about their daily lives. Realistically rendered city views or posters of pop stars contrast with cartoon sketches of iconic objects or droll vignettes, like a housewife walking her pet pig and a Godzilla statue in a local park.With wit, a playful sense of humor, and the colored pencils of his kit, Florent Chavouet sets aside the question of urban ugliness or beauty and captures the Japanese essence of a great city.

## [The Fixer: A Story from Sarajevo](http://amzn.to/2hE1bHa)

Author: [Joe Sacco](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32468.Joe_Sacco)

![The Fixer: A Story from Sarajevo](https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312030143l/307448.jpg)

When bombs are falling and western journalism is the only game left in town "fixers" are the people who sell war correspondents the human tragedy and moral outrage that makes news editors happy.

It's dangerous, a little amoral and a lot desperate.

Award-winning comix-journalist Joe Sacco goes behind the scene of war correspondence to reveal the anatomy of the big scoop. He begins by returning us to the dying days of Balkan conflict and introduces us to his own fixer; a man looking to squeeze the last bit of profit from Bosnia before the reconstruction begins. Thanks to a complex relationship with the fixer Joe discovers the crimes of opportunistic warlords and gangsters who run the countryside in times of war. But the west is interested in a different spin on the stories coming out of Bosnia. Almost ten years later, Joe meets up with his fixer and sees how the new Bosnian government has "dealt" with these criminals and Joe ponders who is holding the reins of power these days...
