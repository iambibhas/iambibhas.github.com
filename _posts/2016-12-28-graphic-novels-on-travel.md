I love graphic novels. They are a visual treat, the best way to tell stories. And I also like to travel and reading about travel stories. I've come across some graphic novels on travel that tells you about real places and real people. So thought of mentioning them here. I've read some of them, and plan to read the others soon.

Guy Delisle's work for a French animation studio requires him to oversee production at various Asian studios on the grim frontiers of free trade. His employer puts him up for months at a time in 'cold and soulless' hotel rooms where he suffers the usual deprivations of a man very far from home. After _Pyongyang_, his book about the strange society that is North Korea, Delisle turned his attention to Shenzhen, the cold, urban city in Southern China that is sealed off with electric fences and armed guards from the rest of the country. The result is another brilliant graphic novel - funny, scary, utterly original and illuminating.
