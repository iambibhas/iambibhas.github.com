title: PHP Console Inside Your Browser
---
I was looking for a tool where I can write a little snippet in PHP and test it out/debug really quickly. First thought of something like these online compilers, like IDEONE. But it's too heavy for my taste. I needed something faster. Yesterday, came across <a href="http://seld.be/notes/php-console-in-your-browser" target="_blank">this blog post</a> from Jordi Boggiano, who saved some work of mine(and lot of other developers) and made a tool that can run inside your browser, and let you run and debug PHP codes with ease, and it's also FAST.<!--more-->Here is a screenshot -

Looks good, right? You can <a href="http://github.com/seldaek/php-console" target="_blank">grab the tool from github</a> and use it on your localhost or your personal server, wherever you want. :)
