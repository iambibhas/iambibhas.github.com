Holi as a festival kind of sucks for me. I guess that's mostly because I don't like the idea of having fun while bathing in artifical colors.  So, I have to stay home for at least 3 days when everybody is "spreading the joy" outside. And if I go outside, they will share their "joy" with me too regardless of if I want to be a part of it or not. And they are not very considerate either. We Indians are *really* strict about that.

But this time Holi is actually being awesome because four of us friends are staying inside with our computers. Wherever I look there is code, computer, boxes of foods that have been eaten, camera, bean bag and lot of concentration. I'm trying to become a bit less Indian about it and not forcing others to do the same. With you all(well, maybe not all) a Happy Holi.
