I had a quick visit to the venue today. As I'm volunteering this time, will be visiting tomorrow too, to help set up everything including the directions. So I thought, it's better if I just let you know of the location of the venue.

It's just beside <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/3rljG" target="_blank"><strong>Christ College</strong> bus stoppage</a>. For those who don't know, here is the general location of the Christ college stoppage and the venue -

Once you get to the Christ College stoppage, follow this path -

And you'll find yourself at the venue. :)

Just for reference, here is the co-ordinates of the venue - <a title="PyCon India 2012 Venue" href="https://maps.google.co.in/?q=loc:12.9349,77.6052" target="_blank">12.9349, 77.6052</a>(Clickable).

See you at the venue. :)
