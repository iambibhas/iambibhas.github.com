title: Heads Up! A new challange ahead.
---
Being a part of Webprachar, I've been hearing about this coding competition "<a title="Code to Win [Facebook]" href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=138192706215485&amp;ref=ts" target="_blank">Code to win</a>" for some time.. Well, this is definitely one of those things that you swing before me and I'll definitely behave like Ping when a bone is swung before her. :P

Sumit da has been very cautious about the details in front of me as he surely knew I was gonna take part. And I have the details now.<strong> <em>Make a <a title="Last.fm Home" href="http://last.fm" target="_blank">Last.fm</a> app</em></strong>.

This is the game of API all the way.. Again..

Thank god Some major works are finished. And I'm a bit free now(with respect to last few days). So I should be able to manage some time for this thing.

Already took a look on the API. easy enough. The only problem is UI. I'm such a Lame designer. :( I wish someone had made me a good UI. :( I could concentrate entirely on the code then. :(

<em><strong>Edit:</strong></em> <strong>The site has been completed.. You can see the outcome at <a href="http://bibhas.in/blog/2010/08/play-this-last-fm/" target="_self">Another post of this blog</a>.</strong>
