This August has been special for all the Python lovers in India for it's being celebrated as "Python Month" by PyCon India. Volunteers all around the country have been visiting colleges and organizing workshops to promote and spread the awesomeness of Python. There has been few workshops in West Bengal as well. I attended and helped organize two of them. One at the B.P.Poddar Institute of Management and Technology and Netaji Subhash Engineering College.

The workshop at BPPIMT was organized by CampusHash. Sanket and Rohit, who run CampusHash, has been kind enough to extend their support in organizing workshops around the country. The college management was really helpful, and the number of attendees were good.

In the other hand, NSEC had a very concentrated crowd. We had to organize it in a rush, so we had to do it small. We took a small computer lab so that everyone could try out things that were being discussed. The volunteers Debjeet, Sneha, Nilabhra, Puja and others from that college were really helpful and the workshop was a success. :)

There has been more workshops in West Bengal. CampusHash organized two more workshops at Heritage Institute of Technology and Institute of Engineering and Management. And some students from B.C.Roy Engineering College, Durgapur organized another workshop there.

This is just the start. PyCon is next week. After that we'll have more of these coming to Kolkata. :)
