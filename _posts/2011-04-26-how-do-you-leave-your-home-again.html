title: How Do You Leave Your Home, Again?
---
Received my <a title="And They Called My Name" href="http://bibhas.in/blog/2011/02/and-they-called-my-name/" target="_blank">appointment letter</a> last night. Will be joining Persistent Systems Ltd as a Software Engineer. Have to leave for Nagpur in September..

This will be my third time leaving a hometown and shifting to another. And it wasn't easy the first two times. Wondering how I'm going to manage this time..

First time I left shifted from one city to another, I was a little kid of 7-8 years. So almost felt nothing as I had new enjoyments, new toys to play with in the new city. Second time, it was a bit hard. Left all my relatives, my cousins, my school friends. But as I found later, I'm extremely good in adapting with a new situation. I can blend in to a new environment really fast. Without anyone noticing it. So handled it somehow.

But, what about this time?

Its different. I have to leave my city, the City of Joy, away from my family, friends, inspirations, my love.. How can I adjust without them..?

I'm hoping for the best till now. For years, I've made friends with people around the country. I've been friends with <a href="http://www.karthikrewired.com/" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="http://chetangole.com/" target="_blank">great</a> <a href="http://www.akshul.com/" target="_blank">people</a> from Nagpur. I'm hoping that I'll be just fine with them around.

But still.. How.. Can't figure. Leaving things to the hands of time. Lets see.
