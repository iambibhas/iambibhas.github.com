title: How aware are you of what's going around you?
---
Tonight I came across few youtube videos that pointed out how we tend "not to notice" things that we're not expecting. I'll say no more and let you watch them and see for yourselves.

How did you like it? Feel stupid? Confused? Want to watch again? Go ahead. Once you're satisfied realizing what just happened, watch the later one.

Had enough fun yet?

Yes, this is the fact. It is just as the video says, "It's easy to miss something you're not looking for". It can be anything from a Dancing Bear to a bear's statue replaced by an iron armor. And if you're not cautious enough, this might wind you up into something fatal.

So, keep your eyes open. :)
