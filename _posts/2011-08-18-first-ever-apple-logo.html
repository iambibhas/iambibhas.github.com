This logo was designed by Ron Wayne, the designer of Apple Inc at that time. The logo features Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an apple tree. It was inspired by a quotation by Wordsworth that was also inscribed into the logo that said:
<blockquote><strong>“Newton… A Mind Forever Voyaging Through Strange Seas of Thought... Alone.”</strong></blockquote>
