title: Facebook's New (Evil) Plan to Grab New Users
---
I don't know when it started, but it came to my notice with these two tweet from my friend -

https://twitter.com/rish404/status/236539167801241600

https://twitter.com/rish404/status/236540498708406272

Now this seemed strange. I asked him to forward me the sms sent from Facebook. So he forwarded me this -

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="384"]<a href="http://i.imgur.com/paHAj.png"><img title="SMS from Facebook" src="http://i.imgur.com/paHAj.png" alt="" width="384" height="344" /></a> SMS from Facebook[/caption]

Now just to test the link, I clicked it, and it opened Facebook.com's 'Merge Account' page, which asked me to add the mobile number of @rish404's mother(Yes, it showed the whole 10 digits) to my profile!

And it doesn't end here. I of course wasn't gonna add it to my profile(Someone else could have), so I cancelled the prompt and that took me to the mobile site of Facebook and to my profile, but interestingly enough, I get a friend request immediately from that "Advancetehri" person(which honestly looks like a spam profile to me), just like my friend did.

Now here are few questions around it -
<ol>
	<li>How did Facebook get the phone number of someone who is no where near opening an account on Facebook?</li>
	<li>Why is Facebook prompting to add the mobile number to whoever opens that link?</li>
	<li>Why is the person clicking the link, getting a friend request instantly from the said person?</li>
</ol>
Now one guess might be that Facebook is trying to get people who are not using Facebook, to use it by collecting mobile numbers that are not in their database. In that case, where they are collecting it from is a big question. And for the case where whoever clicks the link gets prompted to add the number to their profile might be a way for FB to collect more mobile numbers and connect them to a person. That way they get a bigger database.

First I thought about this being a third party exploit. But then I remembered, Facebook doesn't allow automating the process of sending and accepting friend request. So this has to be done by Facebook only.

Now I don't have answers to those questions. Will just wait and see if anyone else has.
