title: Google's +1 Button and My View on it
---
Google recently introduced a new feature to be used with their search engine, sort of a plugin you can say, calling it the +1 button.. Now those of us who use internet forums, know very well what is the value of those two letters -&gt; +1. Google took that idea and implemented it in their search engine.<!--more-->

Google says,
<blockquote>Sometimes it’s easier to find exactly what you’re looking for when someone you know already found it. Get recommendations for the things that interest you, right when you want them, in your search results.</blockquote>
So, basically it works like a recommendation system. You can also put the +1 button on your website and ask the visitors to +1 it if they like it.

Now according to Google, this +1 is going to also affect your search results. Google is going to store the recommendation of the people from your network and give those results preferences that others.. Ummm, but wait, what do they mean by people in your network? As they mentioned, it means -
<ul>
	<li>People in your Gmail (or Google Talk) chat list.</li>
	<li>People in your My Contacts group in Google Contacts.</li>
	<li>People you’re following in Google Reader and Google Buzz.</li>
</ul>
Now that's interesting..

It means that, if some people from your *network* starts spamming with the +1 button(which is quite possible with the number of SEOs, pseudo-SEOs and Punks around), you'll start missing good results.. That is real concern.

Well, one solution that I thought should be considered, it to introduce a -1 button too.. Meaning that you can prioritize and deprioritize your results according to your choice.. With only +1 button, you'll have to +1 almost 9 search results if you want an unwanted result to be removed which is at position one.. That's lame.. :-/
