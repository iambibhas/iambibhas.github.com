title: "My New Mate \xE2\x80\x93 LG GW300. :)"
---
I was using my z550i since Feb 2008. Thats about 2.5 years.. And I have to say that SE never failed me. But I still craved for a new mobile. A qwerty phone this time. Well, i wasn't willing to pay a lot on this as I'm gonna buy another one once I get my career going. So its more of a temporary phone. But that doesn't make it less important in anyway. :)

<!--more-->So here it is, My new phone, LG GW300.. :)

As for features, it is a quite normal phone with the prop. OS from LG. Supports multitasking, has a very good inbuilt browser, UI is really good(I actually fell for that. :P), looks really classy, audio is Loud and quality is acceptable, image quality is also acceptable if not great. But it doesn't matter to me as camera is not one of my basic requirements.

QWERTY keypad works good. The keys are oval shaped at the center, that makes them distinguishable from the other keys around.

It has a dedicated key for new message window, means instant message composing(Good for me). :)

PC suite that comes with it is good. but could have been better. I guess I still have the hang of MyPhoneExplorer. :)

Negative points? Camera quality is not that good. Internal memory is very less, but that doesn't matter I think as MicroSD cards are really cheap these days.

Another big minus point, this phone <strong>did not</strong> come with a memory card! I had to buy one for it! :-/

Some people asked me, "Why LG??" To them, LGÂ  is <strong>not</strong> a Bad brand. It Does make decent phones, take Cookie for example. And to me, LG is far more reliable than MicroMax in this range. And also, This phone packs all the features I needed, so, "Why not LG?"

Anyway, Its working pretty good now. So am happy. That's what matters for new phones I think. :)
