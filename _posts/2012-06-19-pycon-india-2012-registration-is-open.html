title: PyCon India 2012 Registration is Open!
---
PyCon is here again! Last year had awesome fun at PyCon 2011 as a beginner python-tamer. This time I'm hoping to have even more fun because I'll be able to understand more of what they are saying. :P<!--more-->

Unlike last time, PyCon 2012 is going to be held in Bangalore, at Dharmaram Vidya Kshetram from September 28-30. More details can be found <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2012/" target="_blank">on their website</a>. And their <a href="http://pyconindia2012.doattend.com/" target="_blank">registration page is at DoAttend</a>. The Early Bird tickets are Rs600 + Rs300. I just bought 'em. Go get them while they last.

Venue being Bangalore is fine for me as I have a friend's home where I can stay. Last year had real trouble with the place to stay in Pune. Had to crash at some unknown friend(!)'s place, then book a hotel room etc etc. But not this time.

Hoping to have some real good time. Also hoping to meet few friends I've only spoken to via web. That should be fun. :)

<em>Update</em>: I wrote <a title="PyCon India 2012 â€“ More Details" href="http://bibhas.in/blog/785/pycon-india-2012-more-details/">another post</a> with more details about PyCon India 2012.
