title: Facebook's Comment Posting Failure Error Handler
---
This is something new I saw today.

While posting a comment in Facebook, for some unknown reason, it couldn't be posted so facebook showed an error message and also provided a "Try Again" button!

Maybe it has been there for sometime, but never encountered it..!
