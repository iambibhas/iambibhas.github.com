title: A Short Trip to Munich

I've always wanted to visit Germany. I like travelling. But travelling abroad has always been a trouble for me, because of all the paperwork that's involved and the 2 failed attempt before(more on this later). That's why travelling to Germany was one of those wishes I never knew if it's going to come true. But this summer I got a chance to travel to Munich.

Actually, I've been talking to a company about working there. I talked to them some 2-3 months back, right after I got married. They liked me over the Skype interviews and asked me to come visit their office for a day.  But TBH I wasn't completely prepared for this. I've always wanted to live and work there, but I didn't know if I was ready for it. And this seemed like a great opportunity to find that out.

So I started preparing for the trip. Applied for the visa about 15 days before the trip as there were bunch of paperworks needed and not to mention enough fund in bank. I've had 2 visa applications rejected before because of lack of fund and probably because I was telecommuting from Kolkata(the Japanese consulate was very concerned about that). Anyway, this time I was in Bangalore so the chances were a bit higher. But I had doubts anyway, as I've heard numerous times how getting a Schengen visa is the hardest among them all.
