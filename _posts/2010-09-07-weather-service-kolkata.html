title: Weather Service Kolkata
---
I was thinking of trying my hands out with both twitter API and a Cronjob. And I was also in a mood of building something quick. So I built a Twitter app that posts Weather updates of Kolkata. :)

Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/Weather_Kolkata" target="_blank">@Weather_Kolkata</a> for the weather updates of Kolkata.

For now, it updates in a 2 hours interval. It fetches the data from Google Weather API. So any wrong info about weather, blame it to Google. :P

The service uses oAuth, so no chance of it to stop updating suddenly, unless I feel like using some other API and the service goes down for maintenance.

I'm also thinking ofÂ  building some more accounts for each of the Metro cities of India. But that is only if I feel like it or someone else asks for it. :)
<blockquote><strong>Note:</strong> After 3 months of downtime, The service is up again! :D</blockquote>
